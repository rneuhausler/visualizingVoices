0,Groundwater pumping can increase arsenic levels in irrigation and drinking water,,2018-06-05," Groundwater pumping can increase arsenic levels in irrigation and drinking water Date: Stanford University Summary: Pumping an aquifer to the last drop squeezes out more than water. A new study finds it can also unlock dangerous arsenic from buried clays -- and reveals how sinking land can provide an early warning and measure of contamination. Share: FULL STORY For decades, intensive groundwater pumping has caused ground beneath California's San Joaquin Valley to sink, damaging infrastructure. Now research published in the journal Nature Communications suggests that as pumping makes the ground sink, it also unleashes an invisible threat to human health and food production: It allows arsenic to move into groundwater aquifers that supply drinking water for 1 million people and irrigation for crops in some of the nation's richest farmland. advertisement
The group found that satellite-derived measurements of ground sinking could predict arsenic concentrations in groundwater. This technique could be an early warning system to prevent dangerous levels of arsenic contamination in aquifers with certain characteristics worldwide.
""Arsenic in groundwater has been a problem for a really long time,"" said lead author Ryan Smith, a doctoral candidate in geophysics at the School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth). It's naturally present in Earth's crust and a frequent concern in groundwater management because of its ubiquity and links to heart disease, diabetes, cancer and other illnesses. ""But the idea that overpumping for irrigation could increase arsenic concentrations is new,"" Smith said.
Importantly, the group found signs that aquifers contaminated as a result of overpumping can recover if withdrawals stop. Areas that showed slower sinking compared to 15 years earlier also had lower arsenic levels. ""Groundwater must have been largely turned over,"" said study co-author Scott Fendorf, a professor of Earth system science and a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.
Releasing arsenic from clay
The research team analyzed arsenic data for hundreds of wells in two different drought periods alongside centimeter-level estimates of land subsidence, or sinking, captured by satellites. They found that when land in the San Joaquin Valley's Tulare basin sinks faster than 3 inches per year, the risk of finding hazardous arsenic levels in groundwater as much as triples.
Aquifers in the Tulare basin are made up of sand and gravel zones separated by thin layers of clay. The clay acts like a sponge, holding tight to water as well as arsenic soaked up from ancient river sediments. Unlike the sand and gravel layers, these clays contain relatively little oxygen, which creates conditions for arsenic to be in a form that dissolves easily in water.
When pumping draws too much water from the sand and gravel areas, the aquifer compresses and land sinks. ""Sands and gravels that were being propped apart by water pressure are now starting to squeeze down on that sponge,"" Fendorf explained. Arsenic-rich water then starts to seep out and mix with water in the main aquifer.
When water pumping slows enough to put the brakes on subsidence -- and relieve the squeeze on trapped arsenic -- clean water soaking in from streams, rain and natural runoff at the surface can gradually flush the system clean.
However, study co-author Rosemary Knight, a professor of geophysics and affiliated faculty at the Woods Institute, warns against banking too much on a predictable recovery from overpumping. ""How long it takes to recover is going to be highly variable and dependent upon so many factors,"" she said.
The researchers said overpumping in other aquifers could produce the same contamination issues seen in the San Joaquin Valley if they have three attributes: alternating layers of clay and sand; a source of arsenic; and relatively low oxygen content, which is common in aquifers located beneath thick clays.
The threat may be more widespread than once thought. Only in the last few years have scientists discovered that otherwise well-aerated aquifers considered largely immune to arsenic problems can in fact be laced with clays that have the low oxygen levels necessary for arsenic to move into most groundwater. ""We're just starting to recognize that this is a danger,"" said Fendorf.
Satellite insights
The revelation that remote sensing can raise an alarm before contamination threatens human health offers hope for better water monitoring. ""Instead of having to drill wells and take water samples back to the lab, we have a satellite getting the data we need,"" said Knight.
While well data is important to validate and calibrate satellite data, she explained, on-the-ground monitoring can never match the breadth and speed of remote sensing. ""You're never sampling a well frequently enough to catch that arsenic the moment it's in the well,"" said Knight. ""So how fantastic to have this remote sensing early warning system to let people realize that they're approaching a critical point in terms of water quality.""
The study builds on research led in 2013 by Laura Erban, then a doctoral student working in Vietnam's Mekong Delta. ""That's where we started saying, 'Oh no,'"" said Fendorf, who co-authored that paper.
As in the San Joaquin Valley, areas of the Mekong Delta where land was sinking more showed higher arsenic concentrations. ""Now we have two sites in totally different geographic regions where the same mechanisms appear to be operating,"" said Fendorf. ""That sends a trigger that we need to be thinking about managing groundwater and making sure that we're not overdrafting the aquifers."" advertisement

1,Groundwater pumping increases arsenic in water,Daily News Egypt,2018-06-06,"Groundwater pumping increases arsenic in water Arsenic is a natural contaminant in groundwater, found in trapped pore waters in aquifer clay beds Jobzella For decades, intensive groundwater pumping has caused ground beneath California’s San Joaquin Valley to sink, damaging infrastructure, particularly between 2007 and 2015, and this may have increased the concentration of arsenic in the water source, according to a modelling study published in Nature Communications on Tuesday. The California Central Valley accounts for around 20% of groundwater withdrawal in the United States, and groundwater is the main source of drinking water for approximately 1 million people in the San Joaquin Valley which is an area of the Central Valley. Arsenic is a natural contaminant in groundwater but is found in high concentrations in trapped pore waters in aquifer clay beds. Aquifer is a layer of water-bearing the bed rock. Under safe groundwater pumping levels, arsenic remains within the clay. The paper suggests that as pumping makes the ground sink, it also unleashes an invisible threat to human health and food production because it allows arsenic to move into groundwater aquifers that supply drinking water to 1 million people and irrigation for crops in some of the nation’s richest farmlands.

3,This Is What It's Like To Live With Toxic Tap Water In California,"Laura Geiser, mettelampcov",2018-02-13,"In 2012, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill that made the state the first in the nation to formally recognize access to safe, clean, and affordable water as a human right. Yet California's Central Valley, the country's hub for agriculture, has been plagued for years by water that is too toxic and dirty to drink, cook with, or bathe in. And while state and local officials have been long aware of the problem, they’ve been unable to put in place a permanent solution, much to the frustration of residents.
It's estimated that there are hundreds of thousands of families in the Central Valley, a large percentage of them minority farmworkers living below the poverty level, whose household water contains toxins. From town to town, residents are told their water may include cancer-causing arsenic and uranium, organ-damaging disinfectant by-products (DBPs), which also increase the risk of cancer, and nitrates, which cause serious health issues for infants . In total, over 300 water systems carry contaminated water into homes and schools, according to California’s Water Resources Control Board . The majority of the pollutants can be traced back to the factory farms that dominate the valley . Photographer Mette Lampcov visited the hard-hit, unincorporated towns of Cantua Creek, Three Rocks, and Seville, all of which rely on either contaminated surface water or aquifers, to shine a light on the dangers and difficulties faced by residents living with unsafe water.

The school's water has the same contaminated water that residents are told to avoid.
According to data on the California Water Board’s website, the contamination of the water in Cantua Creek and Three Rocks is due largely to DBPs. These towns lack the funding necessary to build and continuously operate water treatment facilities.
Low-income farmworkers moved to these unincorporated towns because of the lower tax rate and their proximity to the farms where they work; of the 525 “poor, densely populated … communities” in the San Joaquin Valley, 65% of the population of 310,000 are people of color and 64% are low income, according to CityLab’s review of a 2015 report published by the California nonprofit PolicyLink. It's a paradox: These farmworkers, who are entrusted with producing the food that ends up on most American dinner tables, don't have the means to live in communities with access to safer water.
In 2015, the nonprofit California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation secured a state grant to cover the cost of bottled water deliveries to residents as a stopgap measure in Cantua Creek and El Porvenir, two Central Valley towns. Each month, residents receive bottled water from the water delivery service Sparkletts to make up for the dirty water flowing through their pipes — dirty water for which they still receive a utility bill. In towns where there is no subsidy, residents must pay for bottled water out of their own pockets; that means the contaminated tap water from their wells is often still used for water-intensive tasks like bathing and doing laundry. The subsidy, if not renewed, is scheduled to run out in June this year.

Advertisement California is the country's largest agricultural producer, according to the last completed census in 2012, which also reported that two Central Valley counties reached agricultural sales of over $6 billion. The state also accounts for a fifth of the nation's dairy production . All of this abundant agricultural and factory farming has taken its toll, leaving behind dangerously high levels of nitrates in the groundwater, which Community Water Center, a nonprofit clean-water advocacy group in the San Joaquin Valley, attributes to ""50 years of unchecked use of commercial fertilizers, unregulated and unprotected storage and disposal of animal wastes, and septic systems.""
Meanwhile, the severe drought that has continued to plague the landscape compounds the state’s compromised water situation. As highly water-dependent crops such as almonds and pistachios have risen in popularity, farmers have rushed to grow them. And without proper regulations for water sourcing, many farms have invested in drilling deeper wells that are significantly bigger than those that serve the average family or individual resident, causing them to concentrate any contaminants present in the groundwater and, in some cases, dry up completely. In 2014, Gov. Brown signed a law to regulate the speed at which aquifers can be pumped dry. Unfortunately, the law doesn't take effect until 2040, and in 2015 farmers dug more wells in the Central Valley than during any other year on record. The depth and speed with which farmers have been pumping the Central Valley dry of its groundwater in the last five years have also caused large parts of the valley to sink, causing billions of dollars in damage and problems for bridges, tunnels, and canals.
However, there’s reason to believe that cleaner water is on the horizon for the beleaguered area: Last year, State Sen. Bill Monning introduced the Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund bill , which proposes adding a tax of less than $1 to water utility bills for all California residents to ensure the safety of water for its most vulnerable population. The tax, which is the state’s first for a water bill, may be the only sustainable solution. Images like Lampcov’s help keep the focus on just what’s at stake.

Firefighting foam used by unit of Johnson Controls poses toxic threat to Green Bay Lee Bergquist , Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Published 6:15 a.m. CT March 19, 2018 | Updated 7:23 a.m. CT March 19, 2018 Buy Photo The discovery of the pollutants at Tyco Fire Products in Marinette prompted the company, a unit of Johnson Controls International, to supply water to about 100 homeowners with private wells. The Department of Natural Resources ordered Tyco to conduct more work this year to evaluate the extent of contamination. (Photo: Mark Hoffman/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) Buy Photo CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE An underground plume of contamination from a firefighting training facility in Marinette has spread from the site and could be seeping into Lake Michigan’s Green Bay, a little more than a mile away. The pollutants are the first in Wisconsin where a class of contaminants known as perfluorinated chemicals have been found in private wells, according to the state Department of Natural Resources. The groundwater contamination prompted Tyco Fire Products, a unit of Johnson Controls International, to supply bottled water to about 100 homeowners in the Town of Peshtigo starting in December. In a few cases, where levels of contaminants are higher, the company has installed carbon filtration systems. 
Jeff Lamont is a part-time Marinette resident whose well was contaminated with toxic chemicals from a nearby manufacturer. (Photo: Lee Bergquist/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) The chemicals are among a group of pollutants that are seen as emerging health concerns and have been linked to illnesses ranging from some cancers to developmental problems in fetuses. ""It's huge,"" said Jeff Lamont, a property owner and professional hydrogeologist whose well has been tainted with the chemicals. ""I just don't think we know the full impact of this yet."" The compounds break down slowly in the environment, and human epidemiological studies have found associations with high cholesterol, liver problems, thyroid disorders and decreased response from vaccinations, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In November 2016, the EPA issued an advisory recommending a permissible limit in drinking water for PFOA and PFOS — the same two chemicals found in the groundwater in and near the Tyco site. The advisory is not enforceable, but some states, including Minnesota, are taking stricter actions. LIKE US ON FACEBOOK: Get the latest Journal Sentinel news in your feed Perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS, have been used in products ranging from carpets and nonstick pans to industrial processes and fire control. Tyco’s 380-acre fire technology center is used for testing, research and training where water-based foams are sprayed in firefighting exercises. The chemicals have been used since the 1960s, according to the company. The company said it first provided data to the DNR on Nov. 22, 2016, after the chemicals were discovered on the property. Then came a series of meetings over several months with the DNR and the City of Marinette on a sampling program. On Jan. 16, the DNR directed Tyco and Johnson Controls to submit plans to investigate the extent of contamination in the soil and groundwater and eventually clean it up. Tyco and its consultant submitted documents this month on how it will determine the scope of the problem, and a DNR official said last week the agency is now reviewing those plans. “We remain committed to this community. We live here and we work here,” said Fraser Engerman, director of global media relations for Johnson Controls International. The company's North American headquarters is based in Glendale. In an email, he said: “We are conducting further investigation to clearly determine the extent of PFOS or PFOA in the groundwater and wells, and we will develop with the DNR, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and other appropriate regulatory bodies a plan to provide clean drinking water system solutions to the identified homes.” The company has held two public meetings to answer questions about the contamination. RELATED: Pollutants likely to create longest dead zone yet in Green Bay The contaminants have probably reached Green Bay, according to Steve Ales, the DNR’s field operations manager for remediation and redevelopment. “There is no data yet to support that, but I would not be surprised,” Ales said. “It certainly could have.” Lamont, 61, lives about 75 yards from Green Bay. A retired hydrogeologist who managed the cleanup of contaminated industrial sites, Lamont said groundwater and surface water flow toward the shoreline. “It’s definitely pooping out into the bay,” Lamont said. Marinette has a population of about 10,000 and gets water from Green Bay. The city’s public water system has not been affected. Neil Motto, who operates the system, said tests have shown no signs of the chemicals. Since December, tests from 130 wells show 11 above the EPA’s health advisory of 70 parts per trillion and 26 where the chemical is present. There was no detection of the chemicals in 93 wells. Lamont spends about three or four months at his home in Marinette and the rest of the year at his second home in Port Washington. He is one of the leaders of a group that is tracking the company’s response, reviewing the technical data and mulling their options, including a lawsuit. Lamont’s own results: 21 parts per trillion for PFOA and a second test of 23 parts per trillion. His neighbor, who lives next to the water, had a 37. Meanwhile, two other neighbors no more than a football field away had readings of 88 and 120, Lamont said. “We’re in the middle of a cluster,” Lamont said. His group wants to make sure Tyco takes no shortcuts. His members are also pushing for first-time standards for the chemicals in Wisconsin. Lamont believes Tyco’s investigation has shortcomings: The company should be taking more soil samples, seems to be avoiding some hot spots and is not testing water or fish in the bay. Engerman, of Johnson Controls, said the company has tried to be transparent . “We are now conducting an investigation to determine movement and path of groundwater,” he said in an email. “Once we have that information, working in conjunction with DNR we will determine what additional investigation and where will be necessary.” On a separate front, on March 2, the DNR asked the state Department of Health Services to recommend safe toxicity levels of 16 substances in groundwater, including PFOA and PFOS, which could lead to new restrictions on the chemicals. In Wisconsin, the rule-making process for adding new chemicals can take years to complete. In May 2017, the Minnesota Department of Health issued a recommendation of 35 parts per trillion for PFOA and 27 parts per trillion for PFOS for public water systems and private well owners. The agency said that it would use the guidance to ensure that “polluting entities are held accountable for cleanup and remediation of contaminated sites.” RELATED: Wisconsin allows 3M to settle pollution case without paying fine In February, 3M Co. agreed to pay the State of Minnesota $850 million to settle a lawsuit over the company’s disposal of the chemicals and the ensuing groundwater contamination. The chemicals affected the drinking water of 67,000 residents in the Twin Cities area. Other states that are placing limits on the chemicals include Michigan, New Jersey, California, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Rhode Island and Washington.

5,Near incineration of psychiatric hospital highlights need for more beds,jsonline.com,2018-01-07,"As fire raged in Ventura, Calif., earlier this month, Gracie Hartman made her way to the county fairgrounds to look for her friend, Fernando. She found him there at the evacuation center, among 69 patients from the Vista del Mar acute psychiatric hospital, one of two such facilities in the county. They had been removed with little time to spare as the hospital was overtaken by flames.
Over the next couple of days, Fernando was transferred to one general hospital as a stopgap, then to another, because, unlike the first, it would accept his insurance.
“He was so upset, that he was throwing up,” said Hartman, who spoke on condition that Fernando be identified only by his first name to protect his privacy. “It was a nightmare.”
Overnight, the private hospital’s shutdown wiped out about two-thirds of the psychiatric hospital capacity in Ventura County, population 850,000. That a fire could so quickly devastate a county’s inpatient psychiatric services only underscores how few beds there are — a phenomenon that holds true across California and nationwide.
“It’s a huge loss,” said Dr. Bryan Wong, chief medical officer of the county-run Ventura County Medical Center, which has a 43-bed psychiatric unit. “It leaves us vulnerable. It was a crisis even before the fires. We were at full capacity consistently. Now, it’s turned into a level beyond that.”
There are about 8,805 acute psychiatric beds in California, according to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development — not enough, advocates say, to meet the need. California has about 15 psychiatric beds per 100,000 residents compared with a recommended standard of 50 beds for 100,000 people, according to the Arlington, Va.-based Treatment Advocacy Center, which promotes greater access to mental health treatment.
The country has struggled with a national shortage of psychiatric hospital beds for many years. Last year, the United States had 37,679 state psychiatric beds, down 13% from 2010, according to the center.
The closure of public psychiatric hospitals has left many people with nowhere to go for treatment during an acute mental health crisis, according to the Virginia-based center. Without a reliable source of inpatient care, patients languish in overcrowded emergency rooms or, even worse, deteriorate until they’re arrested and jailed, often for minor infractions. Some become homeless.

BAKERSFIELD, Calif. — Community and environmental groups filed an appeal today challenging a Kern County Superior Court’s decision upholding a county ordinance that fast-tracks oil and gas permitting.
The ordinance — drafted by the oil industry itself — allows thousands of new oil and gas wells to be drilled every year without any site-specific environmental review or public notice for the next 25 years or more.
“Kern residents living closest to oil and gas wells have been concerned about the impacts increased drilling has on their health,” said Caroline Farrell, an attorney representing local community groups Committee for a Better Arvin, Committee for a Better Shafter and Greenfield Walking Group. “They already suffer from some of the worst air in the nation and water that they cannot drink.”
The ordinance, which three oil-industry groups spent more than $10 million to develop, was adopted in 2015 by the Kern County Board of Supervisors. Community and environmental groups then sued Kern County to overturn it.
On April 20, 2018 the court issued a judgment upholding the ordinance despite finding the county’s environmental impact report was flawed and violated the California Environmental Quality Act. Specifically, the court found that the report failed to consider the health and environmental dangers of road-paving as a mitigation measure and also neglected to assess the destruction of valuable rangeland.
The ordinance will inflict the most harm on Kern County’s low-income communities and communities of color, who already breathe some of the dirtiest air in the nation. Fracking and other oil-production projects are disproportionately sited near their homes, schools and public spaces. Under the ordinance, they will have little to no recourse to challenge further oil and gas extraction in their neighborhoods.
Today’s appeal will be heard by the 5th District Court of Appeal in Fresno, Calif.
“This ordinance is a dangerous scheme cooked up by the county and the oil industry to dodge our state’s bedrock environmental protections,” said Hollin Kretzmann, an attorney at the Diversity. “We’ll keep fighting for the health and future of Kern County residents and to stop this disastrous polluter giveaway.”
“We will continue to fight back against this attempt by the Kern County Board of Supervisors to put Big Oil's interests above the health and safety of our communities,” said Gordon Nipp, vice chair of the Sierra Club Kern-Kaweah Chapter. “We should not be forced to breathe dirty air and drink contaminated water in the name of fossil fuel industry profits. We demand better — better for our families, better for our health and better for our environment.”
“Kern County should not and cannot ignore state-mandated environmental review for 20 plus years just to appease the oil industry, all to the detriment of the health and safety of local communities. The county’s maneuver to skirt thorough environmental review is unprecedented and unlawful,” said Earthjustice staff attorney Colin O’Brien. ","['Kern', 'Arvin']",biologicaldiversity.org
7,Appeal Urges Water Board to Halt Oil-waste Dumping Into Polluting Pits in Kern County,,2018-05-07," Clare Lakewood, (510) 844-7121, clakewood@biologicaldiversity.org Appeal Urges Water Board to Halt Oil-waste Dumping Into Polluting Pits in Kern County Chemicals From Unlined Pits Already Contaminating Groundwater
SACRAMENTO, Calif. filed an appeal today challenging the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board’s decision to allow continued dumping of toxic oil-waste fluid into 83 unlined pits near Buttonwillow, Calif. The board’s staff confirmed that harmful chemicals discharged into these pits have migrated to groundwater and contaminated multiple aquifers in Kern County.
“The regional board has utterly failed in its duty to protect California’s groundwater from chemicals that make us sick,” said Clare Lakewood, a senior attorney at the Center. “The community shouldn’t have to sacrifice its precious water resources just so the oil industry can save a few bucks on wastewater disposal.”
Valley Water Management Company dumps an average of 2.8 million gallons of chemical-laden wastewater per day into its McKittrick 1 and 1-3 pit facilities near Buttonwillow. The contamination has spread underground for at least 2.2 miles, but the full extent of the damage is still unknown.
At its meeting on April 5, the regional board rejected calls to stop Valley Water’s discharges into the pits, allowing the dumping to continue indefinitely. Today’s appeal calls upon the State Water Resources Control Board to rescind the regional board’s decision and order an immediate halt to the discharges.
The regional board’s staff report confirms that wastewater has reached multiple groundwater sources below, including those connected to active water-supply wells. It also confirms that the discharged wastewater contains hazardous chemicals, including dangerous levels of cancer-causing benzene.
As a result of the contamination, groundwater that had been suitable for municipal and agricultural use is now unsuitable for both.
California is one of the only states in the country that allows disposal into unlined pits. There are hundreds of active pits around the state. In 2015 an independent scientific panel recommended that California phase out the use of unlined pits, citing their danger to groundwater.
“For the sake of the Central Valley’s health and economy, the state board must step in and halt the dangerous discharges at this facility now,” Lakewood said. “Every day the water boards refuse to act, the contamination will get worse.” ",['Kern'],biologicaldiversity.org

BAKERSFIELD, Calif. — The Trump administration today took the first step in a process that could open more than a million acres of public land and mineral estate in central California to oil drilling and fracking. The move could end a five-year-old moratorium on leasing federal public land in the state to oil companies.
 Bureau of Land Management seeks comments on the potential harms of fracking in 400,000 acres of public land and an additional 1.2 million acres of federal mineral estate in Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Tulare and Ventura counties.
“This step toward opening our beautiful public lands to fracking and drilling is part of the Trump administration’s war on California,” said Clare Lakewood, “We desperately need to keep these dirty fossil fuels in the ground. But Trump is hell-bent on sacrificing our health, wildlife and climate to profit big polluters.”
In 2015 the Center Los Padres ForestWatch, represented by Earthjustice, successfully sued the BLM for approving a resource management plan allowing oil and gas drilling and fracking on vast stretches of California’s public lands without adequately analyzing and disclosing the impacts of fracking on air quality, water and wildlife.
As a result of the groups’ legal victory, the BLM agreed to complete a new analysis of the pollution risks of fracking before deciding whether to allow drilling and fracking on public land across California’s Central Valley, the southern Sierra Nevada and in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties.
The BLM has not held a single lease sale in California since 2013 when a federal judge first ruled that the agency had violated the National Environmental Policy Act by issuing oil leases in Monterey County without considering the environmental dangers of fracking.
Fracking is an extreme oil-extraction process that blasts toxic chemicals mixed with water underground to crack rocks. The public lands at stake encompass “numerous groundwater systems that contribute to the annual water supply used by neighboring areas for agricultural and urban purposes,” a federal judge noted in 2016.
A 2015 report from the California Council on Science and Technology concluded that fracking in California happens at unusually shallow depths, dangerously close to underground drinking water supplies, with unusually high concentrations of chemicals, including substances dangerous to human health and the environment.
Today’s announcement comes after San Luis Obispo residents, concerned about the harms fracking poses to their county, placed a voter initiative on the November election ballot. If passed, Measure G will ban fracking and new oil and gas wells in San Luis Obispo County.
“It’s great that BLM is finally going to look at this problem,” said Greg Loarie, an attorney at Earthjustice. “But analyzing the impacts of fracking is like analyzing the impacts of smoking cigarettes: there’s really no question that more fracking would be terrible for California.”
The BLM’s 30-day comment period for the proposal begins today. ","['Kern', 'Tulare']",biologicaldiversity.org

BAKERSFIELD, Calif. — Seventy-two environmental, public-health and community groups sent a letter today to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke opposing the Trump administration’s plans to reopen more than a million acres of public land and mineral estate in central California to oil drilling and fracking.
Today’s letter responds to the Bureau of Land Management’s Aug. 8 request for comments on the harms of fracking on 400,000 acres of public land and an additional 1.2 million acres of federal mineral estate in Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Tulare and Ventura counties. That BLM request was the first step in a process that could end a five-year-old moratorium on leasing federal public land in the state to oil companies.
“These beautiful California landscapes are priceless, but Trump and Zinke want to sell them off to their oil industry buddies,” said Clare Lakewood, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Fracking these wild places would threaten our health, fuel the climate crisis and push endangered species like the San Joaquin kit fox to the brink of extinction.”

California allows oil companies to dump millions of gallons of wastewater into open, unlined pits across the state. Investigative Reporter Stephen Stock reports. (Published Tuesday, May 22, 2018) Fred Starrh’s family near Shafter, California, used to have good, clean water under their land that they used for their crops. Starrh said that was before oil companies next door started dumping their waste into open, unlined “percolation ponds” near the Starrh farm. “They had a 12-inch pipe that was running water continuously, this black, oily water,” he said. And, Starrh said, “They had about a mile of ponds.” Fred Starrh says oil company Aera Energy destroyed his family farm's water. Aera is owned by ExxonMobil and Shell. Photo credit: NBC Bay Area The Starrh family sued the owner of those waste ponds, Aera Energy, a company owned by both ExxonMobil Energy and Shell Global, charging that Aera destroyed their fresh water by polluting the groundwater under the Starrh land through the continuous use of those open waste pits next door. Click here for the civil lawsuit complaint “You know you have this resource that you can never replace,” said Fred’s son, Larry. “It was like, man, this isn’t right. It was intentional polluting, and they knew that.” Fred Starrh added: “We were not able to pull up water to irrigate our crops, which we are desperately short of all the time. So that’s the bottom line.” “They took over his land as if they owned it as their dumping ground,"" Starrh’s lawyer, Ralph Wegis, said. ""And they just had their way with it.” Ralph Wegis, a lawyer based in Bakersfield, describes how the Starrh family farm's groundwater was polluted by oil waste from drilling operations. (Apr 20, 2018) Photo credit: NBC Bay Area With the help of Wegis, who is based in Bakersfield, the Starrhs waged a 13-year battle against Aera Energy in court. “They have a mountain of (underground) pollution, and it’s still moving,” said Wegis. “It’s the worst thing you could do to good water. There’s so much damage. It’s too big to fix.” The practice of dumping wastewater from the recovery of oil into unlined, open pits is one that has been banned in nearly every other state in the U.S. But in California, oil companies can legally dump toxic waste onto the bare ground, into what are called “percolation ponds.” The waste comes from oil drilling, which requires an average of 12 gallons of water for every gallon of oil that is produced, according to the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB), which oversees open dumping. When it comes up out of the well, scientific tests and a staff report from the Water Board show the wastewater can contain toxic chemicals such as benzene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, boron, strontium and toluene. According the CVRWQCB’s incoming Executive Officer Patrick Pulupa, there are at least 1,086 active wastewater ponds stretching from Monterey to Kern County. NBC Bay Area’s Investigative Unit found even more active ponds that are not on the board’s list. “Astonishingly, California is the only oil producing state that allows this reckless practice,” said Hollin Kretzman, a lawyer with the Center for Biodiversity. Officials in Texas say state leaders there banned this practice in 1969 after hundreds of reports of contamination to groundwater. Other states require a barrier at the bottom of a waste pond to protect groundwater below. Only New Jersey allows open, unlined wastewater pits like the ones in California, and New Jersey does not produce oil and gas at the levels of states such as California, Texas, North Dakota and Montana. “It’s very concerning that the contamination is spreading underground to groundwater,” said Kretzman. In just one series of ponds, near the small community of Buttonwillow, in Kern County, California, NBC Bay Area found that oil drilling operations are dumping as much as 4.8 million gallons of wastewater per day during peak periods. Oil companies contend that the toxins are filtered out as the water seeps into the soil, but a report by the staff at the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board concludes polluted water has migrated underground 2.2 miles from the wastewater ponds in one instance and more than a mile in another instance. Click to see McKittrick pond report here “It’s increasingly likely that these pits can contaminate groundwater,” said Dr. Seth Shonkoff, visiting scholar at UC Berkeley’s Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management and executive director of PSE Healthy Energy in Berkeley. Shonkoff is an epidemiologist and environmental scientist who has been researching the water and health issues for more than 15 years. He’s concerned that California’s current policy of allowing this kind of dumping in open pits jeopardizes water supplies that the state will need during future droughts. “It sets us up for a future where we are going to be less certain that people will not be exposed to hazardous chemicals in their water supply,” Shonkoff said. “That kind of uncertainty, as a public health scientist, keeps me up at night.” The agency in charge of regulating many of the ponds is the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Board, which oversees a large swath of California from near the Oregon border down to Kern County. Any company that is discharging waste in a way that could impact water quality needs to get a permit from the water board. Patrick Pulupa is the incoming Executive Director of the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board, which oversees the oil waste ponds in much of California. (May 2, 2018) Photo credit: NBC Bay Area Pulupa admits the agency has “to be totally honest."" ""The regulatory agencies were behind the curve,"" he said. ""I think the drought changed the way people look at groundwater. We could have been doing a better job monitoring these ponds, getting these ponds under modern orders that reflect the 2017-2018 California standards. I think to that extent, we we're redoubling those efforts and making sure that all of our discharge permits are modern permits that regulate these ponds appropriately.” It’s estimated it would take $2 billion alone to clean up the toxic waste that now sits under the Starrh family farm. In a statement sent to NBC Bay Area’s Investigative Unit, Aera Energy said: ""As a California company, Aera takes protecting the state’s natural resources seriously and works to meet and exceed program expectations established by the U.S. EPA, State Water Board, Regional Water Quality Control Board and DOGGR to ensure the protection of groundwater quality. In addition, water monitoring networks have been established at our production facilities, and we follow prescribed monitoring and reporting frequencies."" With regard to the lawsuit from the Starrh family, Aera said, ""The facts are that after years of litigation and three jury trials, there was never a finding linking Aera’s operations to damage to tree crops or harmed drinking water resources. The case was finally settled to avoid further expense and the distraction of more protracted litigation."" But in reviewing court records, the Investigative Unit found a verdict from the first jury trial in the Starrhs' case, stating that Aera Energy had “intentionally, recklessly or negligently caused oilfield produced water to enter the subsurface and native groundwater beneath” the farm. Click here to read jury verdict Aera Energy appealed that verdict. And there were two more trials that also were appealed. The appeals stretched on for 13 years, and finally the Starrhs settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount. “It's so strange to see how power can cause a situation to exist that we all know has been wrong,"" Fred Starrh said. ""The agencies who are supposed to be watching it are ignoring it.” Larry Starrh saves much of his frustration and ire with the situation for state and local regulators more so than even the oil and gas companies. “I really do blame our regional water board for a lot of it because they have the power to shut it down,"" Larry said.

Should farmers irrigate crops with waste water from oil extraction? Even with recent rains, the demand for water sources is high. About 80 percent of the water used by Californians goes to agriculture. Stephen Stock investigates as scientists call for a halt to the practice until more is known about the chemicals in that water. Senior Investigative Reporter Stephen Stock reports in a video that first aired on Feb. 17, 2017. (Published Saturday, Feb. 18, 2017) Tom Frantz has been growing almonds near Bakersfield, California most of life, like his father and grandfather before him. He’s concerned about what is known as “produced water.” “We’re not using it on my land,” he says. Like two generations before him, Tom Frantz has been growing almonds near Bakersfield all his life. He doesn’t want to use oil waste water on his trees. Photo credit: Tom Frantz Produced water comes from the Kern River Oil Fields a few miles to the east. It’s a byproduct of extracting oil. To extract one barrel of crude out of the earth, oil companies use between 10 and 100 barrels of water. That water is then filtered through tanks that contain crushed walnut shells, which adhere to the oil. The water then travels into ponds where it is skimmed to remove oil from the surface. If necessary, the water returns once again to the filtering process before being blended with fresh water. It then travels down canals where it is delivered to about 90 farms in the Bakersfield area. Farmers in the area are using more than 20 million gallons of this water each day. Oil companies and the Cawelo Water District have tested the water and assured the farmers that the water is safe. Those farmers sell their produce to the Bay Area and throughout the country, sometimes as organic products. While there are regulations that require companies involved in fracking to reveal the chemicals in their operations, no such rules exist for traditional oil extraction. Last year, the Central Valley Water Board ordered the oil companies to reveal the chemicals they are using. The companies responded with a list of 173 chemicals. Sixty-six of those chemicals are proprietary “trade secrets.” “From a food safety perspective, the thing we’re most concerned about,” says Seth Shonkoff, “is whether these chemicals are going to migrate from the water into the plant, and particularly into the edible portion of the plant.” Shonkoff and a team of scientists from UC Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Labs and PSE, an Energy Science Institute – have recently completed a report that identifies the chemicals and their toxicities. While they couldn’t analyze the chemicals classified as trade secrets, with respect to the rest of them, Shonkoff says, “Forty percent of those rise to the ‘chemicals of concern’ category. A total of 10 chemicals from the list were classified as either carcinogenic or possibly carcinogenic in humans by IARC, the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Scott Smith from Water Defense and Reporter Stephen Stock survey the ponds where oil waster water collects before going out to farms. Photo credit: NBC Bay Area Back in Bakersfield, Scott Smith has been taking water samples in the canals that feed oil waste water to the fields. Smith works for Water Defense, a non-profit group devoted to clean water. As he shows the Investigative Unit a pond that holds some of the waste water, he says, “Smell this – that’s like a kerosene smell, that’s oil! You see that steam coming up – that’s hot oil wastewater.” Smith has cleaned up after oil spills all over the world, but he’s shocked by what he has seen here in the Central Valley. “We detected chromium,” he says, “they did not. We detected nickel. We detected light hydrocarbons, they didn’t even test for it. You can’t find what you don’t look for.” Neither Smith nor Shonkoff have data that says the water is not safe, but they are convinced that more testing is needed before this practice continues. “You should care about what’s going on here if you eat almonds, grapes, tangerines, lemons, citrus, if you shop for organic food,” says Smith. What is happening in the Cawelo Water District in Kern County is coming into your home every night at your kitchen table and your dining room table.” In fact, food from the Central Valley is shipped all over the United States, producing eight percent of the nation’s agriculture. The Chevron Corporation declined requests for an interview, but gave NBC Bay Area News a statement: “Protecting people and the environment is one of Chevron’s core values. Cawelo’s blended produced water supply met all applicable regulatory standards for agricultural use… and showed no cause for concern.” See complete Chevron statement here. The Cawelo Water District says they are continuing to do monthly and quarterly tests of the oil waste water and that so far - all tests show that it’s safe for irrigating crops. Blake Sanden is an irrigation engineer in the Bakersfield area. He’s been working with produced water, and says he’s convinced that any chemical contaminants are at very low levels. He says, “The analyses that I’ve seen in many cases shows a detection of those materials but quite often, even below drinking water standards.” But Tom Frantz, the longtime almond farmer, isn’t convinced: All they can say it hasn’t been proven definitively to be dangerous yet, so let’s continue. That’s what they’re saying. They’re telling us: prove it’s dangerous and we might stop. A canal in the Cawelo Water District.

12,Appeal Urges Water Board to Halt Oil-waste Dumping Into Polluting Pits in Kern County,Center for Biological Diversity,2018-05-08,"Printer-friendly version Chemicals From Unlined Pits Already Contaminating Groundwater
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The Center for Biological Diversity filed an appeal today challenging the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board’s decision to allow continued dumping of toxic oil-waste fluid into 83 unlined pits near Buttonwillow, Calif. The board’s staff confirmed that harmful chemicals discharged into these pits have migrated to groundwater and contaminated multiple aquifers in Kern County.
“The regional board has utterly failed in its duty to protect California’s groundwater from chemicals that make us sick,” said Clare Lakewood, a senior attorney at the Center. “The community shouldn’t have to sacrifice its precious water resources just so the oil industry can save a few bucks on wastewater disposal.”
Valley Water Management Company dumps an average of 2.8 million gallons of chemical-laden wastewater per day into its McKittrick 1 and 1-3 pit facilities near Buttonwillow. The contamination has spread underground for at least 2.2 miles, but the full extent of the damage is still unknown.
At its meeting on April 5, the regional board rejected calls to stop Valley Water’s discharges into the pits, allowing the dumping to continue indefinitely. Today’s appeal calls upon the State Water Resources Control Board to rescind the regional board’s decision and order an immediate halt to the discharges.
The regional board’s staff report confirms that wastewater has reached multiple groundwater sources below, including those connected to active water-supply wells. It also confirms that the discharged wastewater contains hazardous chemicals, including dangerous levels of cancer-causing benzene.
As a result of the contamination, groundwater that had been suitable for municipal and agricultural use is now unsuitable for both.
California is one of the only states in the country that allows disposal into unlined pits. There are hundreds of active pits around the state. In 2015 an independent scientific panel recommended that California phase out the use of unlined pits, citing their danger to groundwater.
“For the sake of the Central Valley’s health and economy, the state board must step in and halt the dangerous discharges at this facility now,” Lakewood said. “Every day the water boards refuse to act, the contamination will get worse.” Printer-friendly version Copy this html code to your website/blog to embed this press release. <a href=""http://www.pressreleasepoint.com/appeal-urges-water-board-halt-oil-waste-dumping-polluting-pits-kern-county"" class=""active"">Appeal Urges Water Board to Halt Oil-waste Dumping Into Polluting Pits in Kern County</a>",['Kern'],pressreleasepoint.com
13,Phase III Data Showed That Venclexta Plus Rituxan Helped People With Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Live Longer Without Their Disease Worsening Compared to Bendamustine Plus Rituxan,Genentech,2017-09-18,"Data from pivotal Phase III study will be submitted to health authorities and presented at an upcoming medical meeting 
South San Francisco, CA -- September 18, 2017 -- 
Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), announced today that the Phase III MURANO study, which evaluated Venclexta ™ (venetoclax) in combination with Rituxan ® (rituximab) in people with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in the time people lived without their disease progressing (progression-free survival [PFS] as assessed by investigator) when treated with Venclexta plus Rituxan compared to bendamustine plus Rituxan. No new safety signals or increase in known toxicities of Venclexta were observed with the treatment combination of Venclexta plus Rituxan. Venclexta is being developed by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. It is jointly commercialized by the companies in the United States and commercialized by AbbVie outside of the United States. 
“Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is considered incurable and becomes harder to treat with each relapse,” said Sandra Horning, M.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “ This is the first study to show that Venclexta plus Rituxan can help people with this type of leukemia live significantly longer without their disease worsening compared to a standard-of-care regimen. We will work with health authorities to bring this potential chemotherapy-free treatment option to the people who need it as quickly as possible. ” 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Venclexta in combination with Rituxan for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL based on promising results from the Phase Ib M13-365 study. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of medicines with early evidence of potential clinical benefit in serious or life-threatening diseases and to help ensure that patients receive access to medicines as soon as possible. 
Venclexta was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in April 2016 for the treatment of people with CLL with 17p deletion, as detected by an FDA approved test, who have received at least one prior therapy. The MURANO study is part of the company’s commitment in the United States to convert the current accelerated approval of Venclexta to a full approval. Data from the MURANO study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to global health authorities. 
About the MURANO study 
MURANO (NCT02005471) is a Phase III open-label, international, multicenter, randomized study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Venclexta in combination with Rituxan compared with bendamustine in combination with Rituxan. All treatments were of fixed duration. The study included 389 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL who had been previously treated with at least one but not more than three lines of therapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Venclexta plus Rituxan (Arm A) or bendamustine plus Rituxan (Arm B). The primary endpoint of the study is investigator-assessed PFS. Secondary endpoints include PFS assessed by independent review committee (IRC), best overall response, complete response, duration of response, overall survival, event-free survival, time to next CLL treatment and minimal residual disease (MRD) status. 
About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) 
CLL is the most common type of adult leukemia, and in 2017, it is estimated there will be more than 20,000 new cases of CLL diagnosed in the United States. Although signs of CLL may disappear for a period of time after initial treatment, the disease is considered incurable and many people will require additional treatment due to the return of cancerous cells. 
About Venclexta 
Venclexta is a small molecule designed to selectively bind and inhibit the BCL-2 protein, which plays an important role in a process called apoptosis (programmed cell death). Overexpression of the BCL-2 protein in CLL has been associated with resistance to certain therapies. It is believed that blocking BCL-2 may restore the signaling system that tells cells, including cancer cells, to self-destruct. Venclexta is being developed by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. It is jointly commercialized by the companies in the United States and commercialized by AbbVie outside of the United States. 
Together, the companies are committed to further research with Venclexta, which is currently being evaluated in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of CLL, along with studies in several other types of cancers. In the United States, Venclexta has been granted four breakthrough therapy designations by the FDA: in combination with Rituxan for people with relapsed or refractory CLL; as a monotherapy for people with relapsed or refractory CLL with 17p deletion; in combination with hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine) for people with untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) ineligible for intensive chemotherapy; and in combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) for people with untreated AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. 
Venclexta Indication 
Venclexta ™ (venetoclax) is a prescription medicine used to treat people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with 17p deletion who have received at least one prior treatment. 
Venclexta was approved based on response rate. There is an ongoing study to find out how Venclexta works over a longer period of time. 
It is not known if Venclexta is safe and effective in children. 
Important Safety Information 
Patients must tell their doctor right away about any side effects they experience. 
Venclexta can cause serious side effects, including tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. TLS can cause kidney failure, the need for dialysis treatment, and may lead to death. A patient’s doctor will do tests for TLS. It is important for patients taking Venclexta to keep their appointments for blood tests. Patients will receive other medicines before starting and during treatment with Venclexta to help reduce their risk of TLS. Patients may also need to receive intravenous (IV) fluids into their vein. Patients taking Venclexta should tell their doctor right away if they have any symptoms of TLS during treatment with Venclexta, including fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, confusion, shortness of breath, seizures, irregular heartbeat, dark or cloudy urine, unusual tiredness or muscle pain or joint pain. 
Patients should drink plenty of water when taking Venclexta to help reduce the risk of getting TLS. Patients should drink 6 to 8 glasses (about 56 ounces total) of water each day, starting 2 days before their first dose, on the day of their first dose of 
Venclexta, and each time the dose is increased. 
Certain medicines must not be taken when patients first start taking Venclexta and while their dose is being slowly increased. Patients should tell their doctor about all the medicines they take , including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Venclexta and other medicines may affect each other, causing serious side effects. Patients should not start new medicines during treatment with Venclexta without first talking with their doctor. 
Before taking Venclexta, patients should tell their doctor about all of their medical conditions, including if they: Have any kidney or liver problems. Have problems with their body salts or electrolytes, such as potassium, phosphorus, or calcium. Have a history of high uric acid levels in their blood or gout. Are scheduled to receive a vaccine. Patients should not receive a “live vaccine” before, during, or after treatment with Venclexta, until their doctor tells them it is okay. If a patient is unsure about the type of immunization or vaccine, they should ask their doctor. These vaccines may not be safe or may not work as well during treatment with Venclexta. Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Venclexta may harm an unborn baby. If a patient is able to become pregnant, the doctor should do a pregnancy test before they start treatment with Venclexta, and they should use effective birth control during treatment and for 30 days after the last dose of Venclexta. Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if Venclexta passes into breast milk. Patients should not breastfeed during treatment with Venclexta. 
Patients taking Venclexta should not drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit, Seville oranges (often used in marmalades), or starfruit while they are taking Venclexta. These products may increase the amount of Venclexta in the patient’s blood. 
Venclexta can cause serious side effects, including: Low White Blood Cell Count (neutropenia): Low white blood cell counts are common with Venclexta, but can also be severe. A doctor will do blood tests to check a patient’s blood counts during treatment with Venclexta. Patients should tell their doctor right away if they have a fever or any signs of an infection. 
The most common side effects of Venclexta include low white blood cell count, diarrhea, nausea, low red blood cell count, upper respiratory tract infection, low platelet count, and feeling tired. 
Venclexta may cause fertility problems in males. This may affect the ability to father a child. Patients should talk to their doctor if they have concerns about fertility. 
These are not all the possible side effects of Venclexta. Patients should tell their doctor if they have any side effect that bothers them or that does not go away. 
Report side effects to the FDA at (800) FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/medwatch . Patients and caregivers may also report side effects to Genentech at (888) 835-2555.

14,"Trump Administration Urged Not to Reopen California Public Lands to Drilling, Fracking",Center for Biological Diversity,2018-09-07,"Posted September 7th, 2018 for Center for Biological Diversity
BAKERSFIELD, Calif. — Seventy-two environmental, public-health and community groups sent a letter today to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke opposing the Trump administration’s plans to reopen more than a million acres of public land and mineral estate in central California to oil drilling and fracking.
Today’s letter responds to the Bureau of Land Management’s Aug. 8 request for comments on the harms of fracking on 400,000 acres of public land and an additional 1.2 million acres of federal mineral estate in Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Tulare and Ventura counties. That BLM request was the first step in a process that could end a five-year-old moratorium on leasing federal public land in the state to oil companies.
“ These beautiful California landscapes are priceless, but Trump and Zinke want to sell them off to their oil industry buddies, ” said Clare Lakewood, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Fracking these wild places would threaten our health, fuel the climate crisis and push endangered species like the San Joaquin kit fox to the brink of extinction.”
In 2015 the Center for Biological Diversity and Los Padres ForestWatch, represented by Earthjustice, successfully sued the BLM for approving a resource-management plan allowing oil and gas drilling and fracking on vast stretches of California’s public lands without adequately analyzing and disclosing fracking’s threats to air quality, water and wildlife.
As a result of the groups’ legal victory, the BLM agreed to complete a new analysis of the pollution risks of fracking before deciding whether to allow drilling and fracking on public land across California’s Central Valley, the southern Sierra Nevada and in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties.
The BLM has not held a single lease sale in California since 2013, when a federal judge first ruled that the agency had violated the National Environmental Policy Act by issuing oil leases in Monterey County without considering fracking’s environmental dangers.
Fracking is an extreme oil-extraction process that blasts toxic chemicals mixed with water underground to crack rocks. The public lands at stake encompass “numerous groundwater systems that contribute to the annual water supply used by neighboring areas for agricultural and urban purposes,” a federal judge noted in 2016.
A 2015 report from the California Council on Science and Technology concluded that fracking in California happens at unusually shallow depths, dangerously close to underground drinking water supplies, with unusually high concentrations of chemicals, including substances dangerous to human health and the environment.
San Luis Obispo residents, concerned about the harms fracking poses to their county, placed a voter initiative on the November election ballot. If passed, Measure G will ban fracking and new oil and gas wells in San Luis Obispo County.
“Residents throughout central California are concerned about the impacts of drilling and fracking near our treasured forests, wildlife refuges, national monuments, nature preserves, schools and trails,” said Los Padres ForestWatch executive director Jeff Kuyper. “Together we’re telling the Trump administration loud and clear that we’re not willing to pollute and industrialize these iconic landscapes.” Printer-friendly version Copy this html code to your website/blog to embed this press release. <a href=""http://www.pressreleasepoint.com/trump-administration-urged-not-reopen-california-public-lands-drilling-fracking"" class=""active"">Trump Administration Urged Not to Reopen California Public Lands to Drilling, Fracking</a>","['Kern', 'Tulare']",pressreleasepoint.com
15,Calling for a Ban on Factory Farming in the United States | Food & Water Watch,drakestraw,2018-05-14,"RSS Calling for a Ban on Factory Farming in the United States
Food & Water Watch Joins Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement to Urge Local, State, and Federal Lawmakers to Protect Americans Against Unsafe Factory Farming Practices Donate 05.14.18
Des Moines, IA – A group of farmers, advocates and community leaders gathered in Iowa today to announce the launch of a national campaign to ban factory farming. Factory farming facilitates an unjust, corporate-driven food system that results in unethical, unsafe and polluting food production practices.
The call for a ban on factory farming is a decisive step necessary to protect all Americans from the dangers of unsustainable food animal production. Factory farms exacerbate climate change and contribute to public health crises, release dangerous toxins into the air we breathe and the water we drink, disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color, and create dangerous and unhealthy conditions for workers and animals. The rise of factory farms in our nation has transformed rural and economically diverse communities into agribusiness-controlled nightmares.
“In 2011, we joined grassroots groups that were demanding a ban on fracking because it’s a threat to our water that turns rural areas into sacrifice zones,” said Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food & Water Watch. “Now, we’re banding together with communities around the country who believe the time for a ban on factory farming has come as well.”
Food & Water Watch also released a report, The Urgent Case for a Ban on Factory Farms , which outlines the policy and regulatory failures that have led the groups to call for a ban on the practice. The report also outlines the climate impacts, the environmental injustice of where these facilities are sited, air and water pollution concerns, antibiotic resistance and other food safety issues, and the impact on rural economies. The report also highlights the massive amounts of manure that highly consolidated livestock operations produce, threatening our waterways: For example, Food & Water Watch calculates that the nearly 500,000 dairy cows on factory farms in Tulare County, California produce five times as much waste as the New York City metropolitan area.
Currently, Iowa houses an estimated 10,000 industrial livestock operations that employ unsustainable methods of raising food animals. Like all factory farms, they pack thousands of animals into confined spaces, pose enormous public health risks, and generate massive amounts of waste. Factory farms in Iowa have high released levels of polluting nitrates into drinking water resources, causing the Des Moines Water Works to pursue costly treatment and upgrades over the years.
“People in Des Moines shouldn’t have to worry about our water quality and rate increases required to clean up the pollution that is coming downstream,” said Cherie Mortice, retired Des Moines teacher and Iowa CCI board president. “But, this isn’t a rural versus urban issue. We’re all in this together, and we’re all concerned about our water.”
The groups are calling for a ban on any new or expanding factory farms, as well as new policies to create a food system that can feed people without this destructive model. Those new policies should include: Enforcing antitrust laws to break up the agribusiness stranglehold on our food system; Establishing programs to ensure grain producers can make a fair living without flooding the market with cheap grains that feed factory farms; And rebuilding the local and regional infrastructure needed for small- and mid-sized livestock producers to transport animals to market.
The groups support existing efforts to enact a legislative moratorium on new and expanded factory farms in Iowa because it would provide immediate relief to people in impacted communities. A legislative moratorium would also allow for an opportunity to quantify the harms the industry has had on Iowa’s water. The groups said they plan to continue working together to build support for legislation that would stop the spread of the factory farming industry in Iowa.
“We’ve seen family farmers essentially wiped out of the livestock business across Iowa, which in turn has decimated our rural communities,” said Barb Kalbach, fourth-generation family farmer and Iowa CCI member from Adair County, Iowa. “Reforming our food and agriculture system so that it works for farmers, workers, eaters, and our environment starts with stopping factory farms.”
“Like fracking, factory farming is too dangerous for our environment to simply regulate,” said Hauter. “We need to work together around the country to stop factory farms and protect our communities, our air and water, and our climate.” Click here to access The Urgent Case for a Ban on Factory Farms .

BAKERSFIELD, Calif - The Trump administration today took the first step in a process that could open more than a million acres of public land and mineral estate in central California to oil drilling and fracking. The move could end a five-year-old moratorium on leasing federal public land in the state to oil companies.
Today’s notice from the Bureau of Land Management seeks comments on the potential harms of fracking in 400,000 acres of public land and an additional 1.2 million acres of federal mineral estate in Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Tulare and Ventura counties.
“This step toward opening our beautiful public lands to fracking and drilling is part of the Trump administration’s war on California,” said Clare Lakewood, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “We desperately need to keep these dirty fossil fuels in the ground. But Trump is hell-bent on sacrificing our health, wildlife and climate to profit big polluters.”
In 2015 the Center for Biological Diversity and Los Padres ForestWatch, represented by Earthjustice, successfully sued the BLM for approving a resource management plan allowing oil and gas drilling and fracking on vast stretches of California’s public lands without adequately analyzing and disclosing the impacts of fracking on air quality, water and wildlife.
As a result of the groups’ legal victory, the BLM agreed to complete a new analysis of the pollution risks of fracking before deciding whether to allow drilling and fracking on public land across California’s Central Valley, the southern Sierra Nevada and in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties.
The BLM has not held a single lease sale in California since 2013 when a federal judge first ruled that the agency had violated the National Environmental Policy Act by issuing oil leases in Monterey County without considering the environmental dangers of fracking.
Fracking is an extreme oil-extraction process that blasts toxic chemicals mixed with water underground to crack rocks. The public lands at stake encompass “numerous groundwater systems that contribute to the annual water supply used by neighboring areas for agricultural and urban purposes,” a federal judge noted in 2016.
A 2015 report from the California Council on Science and Technology concluded that fracking in California happens at unusually shallow depths, dangerously close to underground drinking water supplies, with unusually high concentrations of chemicals, including substances dangerous to human health and the environment.
Today’s announcement comes after San Luis Obispo residents, concerned about the harms fracking poses to their county, placed a voter initiative on the November election ballot. If passed, Measure G will ban fracking and new oil and gas wells in San Luis Obispo County.
“It’s great that BLM is finally going to look at this problem,” said Greg Loarie, an attorney at Earthjustice. “But analyzing the impacts of fracking is like analyzing the impacts of smoking cigarettes: there’s really no question that more fracking would be terrible for California.”

BAKERSFIELD, Calif - The Trump administration today took the first step in a process that could open more than a million acres of public land and mineral estate in central California to oil drilling and fracking.

22,Emergency Drought Assistance Will Be Needed in California for Years,Amel Ahmed,2018-06-06,"Just how long interim funding will play a central role in responding to water issues depends on implementing long-term solutions to contamination and groundwater depletion.
Gov. Jerry Brown declared the end of California’s five-year drought in April 2017 after a wet winter replenished shrinking reservoirs. But the lingering impact of the drought, especially on groundwater supplies , means some still rely on emergency water tanks while they wait for long-term solutions.
This is particularly true in the San Joaquin Valley, where more than 300 domestic well users whose taps have run dry continue to use tanks provided by the state through a program originally slated to end in June.
With the help of emergency funding requested by Assembly member Joaquin Arambula (D-Kingsberg), whose largely rural district is in the valley, the emergency water supply program will likely continue another year at a cost of $3.5 million. Also included in the emergency relief efforts is $10 million to address failing domestic wells and septic tanks, and $10 million for the Drinking Water for Schools Program that funds treatment solutions for schools that struggle with contamination. New state regulations for contaminants like lead and carcinogen 1,2,3-trichloropropane mean schools will need more money to meet safe drinking water standards.
“There are parts of my community that lack access to the basic necessities for life,” said Arambula. He said he frequently encountered patients without access to clean water in his work as an emergency room doctor in the Fresno County city of Selma.
The Senate and Assembly budget committees approved the request and it’s now part of final budget negotiations. As with other line items, the Legislature could still vote to remove the requested money from the budget package before it is finalized.
The money partially bridges a gap in critical services for a group of California residents who lack access to clean water. November analysis by PPIC Water Center estimated about 500,000 people in the state get their water from a system not compliant with safe drinking water standards. That number does not include people who rely on domestic wells.
But the need this funding addresses won’t disappear entirely by the middle of 2019 when the next budget year starts and that’s because many of the problems are related to groundwater overdraft. The state now has more than 20 groundwater basins that are deemed “critically overdrafted.” The San Joaquin Valley is particularly hard-hit and many communities there are entirely reliant on groundwater. As farmers dug deeper wells to keep up with a falling aquifer during the drought, many shallower domestic and community wells were left high and dry.
The nonprofit Self-Help Enterprises , which administers emergency water tank and well-drilling programs in the San Joaquin Valley, says about 320 of its clients still use water tanks. The organization anticipates that number will decline to around 220 by the end of June as many households start using newly drilled wells. These clients represent a large proportion of those in the state who rely on the tanks.

During the drought, the state started providing tanks for free to residents who rely on domestic wells that ran dry. A water truck comes at regular intervals to the residents’ properties to fill the receptacles at no cost. Nonprofits like Self-Help, as well as some counties, administer the tank program and distribute state-funded loans and grants to drill new wells.
“I think we’ll be able to really end the tank program this coming year, barring some other extreme circumstance,” said Self-Help community development manager Jessi Snyder.
But she said the need for new wells will continue in coming years. More applications for help are coming in, Snyder said; hundreds who have requested applications have not completed and returned them yet. Still, the pace of work has slowed down. At the peak of the drought in 2015, Self-Help was seeing around 15–20 requests per week, said Self-Help program director Susan Long. That number has gone down to 10 a month but there is still a backlog. “You just couldn’t get a well driller to respond at the height of the drought,” said Snyder.
Some in the organization’s service area who have not sought help may also be in precarious situations, with wells that may be close to running dry.
There’s a long-term solution that should mitigate the drying up of wells. Groundwater management plans implemented as part of the rollout of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act are intended to prevent excessive pumping of groundwater. But the law, passed in 2014, doesn’t require plans to be in place until 2020, and then it will take years for it to start tangibly impacting groundwater levels.
“We’ve taken decades to get into this situation, and it’s going to take us a couple decades to get out of it, I think,” said Snyder.
In the interim the state is also pushing consolidation, where those with failed wells or unsafe septic systems are connected to nearby systems in working order. Residents living close enough to larger water or sewage systems may feasibly be able to connect to them, and the funding Arambula has requested can also help with that. A University of California, Davis study found that two-thirds of residents in disadvantaged San Joaquin Valley communities without safe drinking water lived within a mile of a system meeting clean water requirements.

But consolidation comes with unknowns: pending legislation and expense.
Two bills, Assembly Bill 2501 and Senate Bill 1215 , would explicitly expand the state’s authority to force absorption of domestic wells and septic tanks into nearby larger systems that function properly. A law already passed, Assembly Bill 88 , allows the state to step in and mandate consolidation of community water systems under some circumstances. The idea is to extend the benefits of larger systems’ economies of scale to areas with smaller systems that lack resources and often have little hope of building those systems up given small ratepayer bases.
If the new bills don’t pass, there will be no guarantee that people who rely on their own private drinking water and septic systems have a chance of connecting to larger, higher-quality systems.
As with implementation of groundwater management plans, consolidation won’t happen quickly. “You are looking at a couple years” in many cases to account for coordination and engineering work, said Phoebe Seaton, codirector of the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability , which sponsored the latest consolidation bills. Incremental solutions, such as emergency water supplies and drilling new wells, are needed in the interim. “At this point, the emergency piece is critical.”
Then there’s the cost. Jennifer Clary, a water policy and legislative analyst for the environmental advocacy group Clean Water Action , said a single new connection to an existing drinking water system could cost between $5,000 and $10,000 depending on how much infrastructure it requires. Connecting an entire community of domestic well users would be more expensive. The $10 million requested for dealing with dry wells and failing septic systems “would be helpful, but would not make an appreciable dent in the backlog of projects,” said Clary.
That’s why Clary, Seaton and others working on water justice issues in California have pushed a long-term funding mechanism. The Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund would create a dedicated supply of around $140 million, annually, for a broad range of water quality efforts including not only treatment of water in schools and consolidation but also ongoing costs of treatment for struggling water systems too remote to consolidate. The fund is included in Governor Jerry Brown’s budget as a trailer bill, and may undergo changes before the final budget faces a vote.
If the trailer bill passes in the budget as proposed, it will still take time for the fund to accumulate. That means the money wouldn’t be immediately available, said Snyder. Which means emergency water needs could still require short-term funding solutions, such as those in Arambula’s request.
“I believe we need temporary relief until we can get to a long-term solution, and we’ll continue to figure out how we can get to those longer-term solutions,” said Arambula.

23,Another Danger from Overpumping Groundwater: Arsenic,Amel Ahmed,2018-06-05,"Sinking land caused by intensive groundwater pumping in the San Joaquin Valley is releasing trapped arsenic — a known carcinogen — into aquifers that supply irrigation and drinking water for a million people, according to a new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications .
Arsenic, a naturally occurring chemical in the Earth’s crust, is undetectable by the human senses and has been linked to a host of diseases including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Researchers at Stanford University say residents should be concerned about arsenic levels in their water supply.
“Arsenic is associated with the clay layers in the groundwater system from which they pump their water,” says study co-author Rosemary J. Knight, a professor of geophysics at Stanford. “Overpumping is going to release that arsenic, and there has been significant overpumping during the recent droughts.”
The link between subsidence (or sinking land) and pumping of fresh water from underground is well-established, according to the US Geological Survey. A previous study led by Knight found that one way of reducing the negative impact of extracting water from the clay layers is for farmers to pull water from more shallow sand and gravel layers.
Knight added that residents who obtain their water from a private domestic well in an area that has experienced subsidence are wise to get the water checked for arsenic.
Researchers examined arsenic levels in hundreds of wells in San Joaquin Valley’s Tulare basin during two drought periods. They found that in areas where land sank more than 3 inches per year, the risk of finding dangerous levels of arsenic in groundwater tripled.
Tulare basin aquifers consist of sand and gravel zones separated by thin layers of clay. The clay, which acts as a sponge, absorbs both water and arsenic, which starts off as a solid. Overpumping draws water from the sand and gravel zones, causing the aquifer to compress as land sinks. As those layers press down on the clay regions, arsenic-rich water gets released into the aquifer.
The study says overpumping in other regions could result in the same effect if they have three characteristics: alternating layers of clay and sand; a source of arsenic; and relatively low oxygen content, which is common for thick clay zones.
The study’s authors say that satellite surveillance can be a powerful tool in protecting communities from contaminated groundwater. Remote sensors that track the measurements of land as it collapses over time can be used to predict arsenic concentrations in groundwater.
This data could serve as an early warning system for contamination.
“Remote sensing data give us an incredible view of what is happening in our groundwater systems,” says Knight. “My hope is that we are entering a new era in California, of sustainable groundwater management, and that data such as these can support and inform wise groundwater management decisions.”
The study notes that aquifers contaminated as a result of overpumping can recover if withdrawals stop; areas that showed slower sinking also had lower arsenic levels.

24,Dozens of Water Systems Consolidate in California’s Farming Heartland,Amel Ahmed,2018-06-12,"Joaquin Valley, one of the most productive farming regions in the nation, an estimated 150,000 people are stuck living with contaminated drinking water. When they open a tap to fill a cooking pot or take a shower, the water that gushes out is contaminated with nitrates, hexavalent chromium, arsenic and other nasties from polluted wells.
The good news: Help is available to many of these small community water systems, provided they can merge with a neighboring utility that has clean water.
Estimating how many such mergers are under way is difficult, because they are at different stages and some may not have reached the attention of state regulators yet. A University of California, Los Angeles study released last year estimated 32 mergers are in progress. Camille Pannu, director of the Water Justice Center at the University of California, Davis, said there are probably more than 50 mergers in the works in the San Joaquin Valley alone.
Whatever the number, the process can be expensive and laborious, despite state laws meant to ease the way.
“It’s definitely a multiyear – often many-year – process,” said Nell Green Nylen, a senior research fellow at the Wheeler Water Institute at U.C. Davis. “A big part of it is funding. And there can be a number of different agencies at different levels that need to be involved.”
Green Nylen is coauthor of a new report summarizing the challenges of water system consolidation. They range from financing problems to a lack of basic data needed to understand the water-quality problems that need solving.
There are legal and bureaucratic challenges, as well. For instance, in the unincorporated town of Tooleville in Tulare County, groundwater wells are contaminated by hexavalent chromium, also known as chromium-6 (the chemical made famous by the 2000 film “Erin Brockovich”). The town of fewer than 400 people has been trying to merge its tiny mutual water company with the municipal water system in the neighboring city of Exeter, which has more than 10,000 residents.
“We can’t cook with the water. We can’t drink it,” said Maria Olivera, a board member of the Tooleville water system and a resident of the town since 1974. “We really need help. Everybody is hoping it will be solved.”
An agreement for the merger finally appears close at hand. But now a financing problem has emerged.
The state’s water-quality standard for hexavalent chromium was struck down by a May 2017 court ruling. The lawsuit was filed by the California Manufacturers and Technology Association and the Solano County Taxpayers Association. The court agreed with the plaintiffs that the state failed to investigate whether compliance with the standard is economically feasible.
As a result, the State Water Resources Control Board was forced to withdraw its water-quality standard for hexavalent chromium while it works on revisions. With no standard in place, water systems trying to solve hexavalent chromium problems are not eligible for state grant funding. Which means Tooleville must seek another source of money to pay for the construction to connect with Exeter’s system.
In the meantime, the state is providing Tooleville with bottled water for drinking and cooking. The tainted well water is still used for cleaning, irrigating and everything else that people need water for. But recently the pump burned out at one of the town’s two wells. If the same should happen at Tooleville’s other well, the town’s water emergency will worsen considerably.
“We don’t have any money to buy a pump and then to hire a person to manage it, and then to pay the electricity bill for the water pumps,” Olivera said. “We are in a big problem right now because there’s no money.”
A state law passed in 2015, Senate Bill 88 , authorized the State Water Resources Control Board to require water system consolidations to fix water quality or reliability problems. Since the law passed, the water board has notified 25 water agencies they must consolidate – all in the San Joaquin Valley.
Fortunately, the construction required to physically connect one water agency with another may be fairly easy in many cases. A U.C. Davis study released in February found that 66 percent of disadvantaged communities in the San Joaquin Valley are within 500ft of another water utility that meets drinking water standards. For the rest, the distance is 3 or more miles, which could make a connection too expensive.

East Porterville lived with groundwater problems for years until the connection was finally made in 2016. (Florence Low, California Department of Water Resources)
Not all water system mergers involve full consolidation. Sometimes, water agencies might want to work together without merging completely. Neighboring water agencies might want to build an intertie, for example, in order to share water resources. But Green Nylen said state assistance programs tend to be available only for full mergers – another weakness in the regulatory process.
One possibility of a partial merger is unfolding in Sacramento County, where the San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District have talked for several years about combining resources.
San Juan is primarily a surface-water agency, with water rights in the American River. Sacramento Suburban primarily relies on groundwater. Combined, the agencies serve around 340,000 people.
If the two could agree to work together and build the necessary plumbing connections, San Juan could use Sacramento Suburban’s groundwater during drought years when American River water might be in short supply. Then, in wet years, it could use American River water to recharge Sacramento Suburban’s aquifers.
“On the face of it, it would seem to give us more opportunity to optimize use of our water supply,” said Paul Helliker, general manager of San Juan Water District. “This is particularly important as we look at what the future holds with climate change and changing regulatory requirements.”
In 2015, board members of the two agencies held a joint meeting to discuss moving ahead with some kind of cooperating agreement. It could range from a full merger to simply collaborating on joint projects. San Juan’s board of directors voted unanimously in favor of proceeding with further negotiations. But the Sacramento Suburban board voted 3-2 against it.
The two agencies recently restarted discussions, Helliker said. Each board has formed a two-member subcommittee for more joint meetings to discuss what form of cooperation to pursue.
In any merger, some of the trickiest issues do not involve money or laws at all, Green Nylen said. Rather, the sticky issues are about who will be in charge, which employees will be retained and deciding whose operating rules are best.
Also, ratepayers often have a variety of concerns. They may fear losing control of “their” water supply. And they may worry about rate increases under a newly consolidated water utility.
“The current round of consolidations has focused on systems where water treatment is just not affordable or financially sustainable unless systems merge,” said Pannu at U.C. Davis. “My understanding is that the state is triaging cases based on the public health impact.”

25,California Finally Begins Regulating Cancer-Causing Chemical Found in Drinking Water,Sasha Khokha,2017-07-22,"Print Update, July 18, 2017: More than 25 years after the state determined that 1,2,3-TCP causes cancer, the State Water Resources Control Board voted to approve a standard for the chemical in drinking water. They set the limit at 5 parts per trillion, a level supported by clean water and pesticide reform advocates. The state will now start water systems to test all of their wells every month starting in January. Board chair Felicia Marcus called the vote, “a very important day for public health.” “It’s a very serious public health threat,” agreed board Vice-Chair Steven Moore. “California officially determined that this is a carcinogen. And when you look at the science and the experiments and all that was done to show it, it is disquieting how serious and insidious this chemical is.” 
Update, June 20, 2017: 
The state water board has proposed a standard for 1,2,3-TCP and held a hearing to receive public comment. The state is proposing that the maximum contamination for 1,2,3-TCP in drinking water be set at 5 parts per trillion. The nonprofit Community Water Center , which advocates for safe, clean drinking water in the San Joaquin Valley, testified in support of the proposed standard. 
State water officials have not yet formally implemented the standard, but they have issued an updated map showing contaminated wells. 
The Fresno City Council has authorized a study to find out how to remove 12,3-TCP from the city’s water supply. 
Update, January 2, 2017: 
In January, The State Water Resources Control Board is expected to roll out the draft of a first-ever enforceable standard for 1,2,3-TCP in California drinking water. 
In December, the city of Clovis, in Fresno County, won a $22 million court judgment against Shell Oil Co., for TCP contamination in wells. More than 40 other cases remain open.

I have to admit, after the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, I’m a little freaked out about what’s in my tap water. So when I opened my water bill from the city of Fresno recently, I decided to actually read the “consumer confidence report” for drinking water. And I found this footnote in tiny print: Consumer Confidence Report Footnote 
123 Trichloropropane has been detected in 29 wells in Fresno…. Some people who use water containing it over many years may have an increased risk of getting cancer, based on studies in laboratory animals. 
Wait…what? I have two little kids, and my family drinks the tap water. And it might cause cancer? I decided to fork out $200 to get mine tested. And to start digging into how 1,2,3-TCP got into the water. 
Turns out, it’s not just Fresno. According to the State Water Resources Control Board , 1,2,3-TCP has been found in about a hundred public water systems across California, mostly in the Central Valley but also in counties like Santa Cruz, Monterey, Sacramento, and Los Angeles. 
But many Californians don’t know whether this stuff is in their water, because neither the state nor the federal EPA regulates 1,2,3-TCP in drinking water. So that means public utilities don’t have to test for it, filter it out, or advise their customers if it’s in the water. 123-TCP IN ACTIVE COMMUNITY WELLS Water systems where significant levels of contaminant 123-TCP have been detected.

That’s even though the state determined it was a carcinogen back in 1992. And the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) set a very low public health goal for 1,2,3-TCP in 2009. 
“There is no absolutely no question that is a genotoxic carcinogen,” says Robert Howd, a toxicologist who led the scientific review for OEHHA. 
There have been no studies of 1,2,3-TCP’s effect on humans, but animal studies showed multiple tumors at multiple sites in both rats and mice. 
“The data are very clear,” Howd says. “Virtually nobody is disputing that. There’s just no controversy about this being a DNA reactive carcinogen.” 
Howd’s team set the public health goal at .7 parts per trillion (.0007 parts per billion) The only carcinogen with a lower state public health goal for drinking water is dioxin. How Did It Get Into the Water? “This whole story begins in the 1930s, the dawn of the age of chemical agriculture” says San Francisco attorney Todd Robins . He represents about 30 communities around the state who are suing over 1,2,3-TCP contamination, and he’s spent the last decade trying to track how it leached into groundwater. “Shell saw a huge opportunity to take a hazardous waste stream from their chemical plants…and start putting it in barrels, and selling it to farmers.” San Francisco attorney Todd Robins 
“Somebody at the Pineapple Research Institute in Honolulu got ahold of this sample of what was essentially hazardous waste from a chemical production process at Shell,” he says, “and he used it in some experiments.” 
The experiments, Robins says, were to figure out how to control nematodes, tiny microscopic worms in the soil that attack a plant’s roots. 
“Shell saw a huge opportunity to take a hazardous waste stream from their chemical plants … and start putting it in barrels, and selling it to farmers,” says Robins. “Then Dow soon followed suit.” 
The companies sold the product to farmers as a fumigant, which is injected into the soil. 
Robins has compiled a huge stack of documents that show neither Dow Chemical nor Shell listed 1,2,3-TCP on their product labels , even though it was one of several ingredients. One of Dow’s own scientists admitted that the compound had served no function killing nematodes. 
Robins shows me a 1974 memo where Dow describes some of the fumigant components as “garbage.” Ralph Gutierrez says Shell and Dow should pay to clean 1,2,3-TCP out of Woodville’s water. (Sasha Khokha) 
“Some of the most startling information is how clearly the companies understood from a scientific perspective the amount of garbage they were putting into these products,” says Robins, “and knowingly having farmers essentially dispose of their hazardous waste for them on farm fields throughout our state.” 
In a few cases, Dow and Shell have paid to clean up groundwater with 1,2,3-TCP. But in the more than 3 dozen cases filed against the companies over the contamination, they’ve never admitted any wrongdoing. 
Both Dow and Shell declined my request for a taped interview. They sent me emails saying they couldn’t comment on active litigation. 
Dow spokesman Randy Fishback wrote that fumigants with 1,2,3-TCP were part of what he called “historical, highly beneficial agricultural products” that “controlled agricultural pests that otherwise would have caused millions of dollars in annual crop losses.” He added those products have been off the market for several decades, and that “TCP is also associated with certain industrial processes in which Dow had no involvement.” 
Tiny Communities Can’t Afford Cleanup Woodville is a small farming community in Tulare County, where the 1,2,3-TCP in the drinking water is ten times the state’s public health goal. (Sasha Khokha/KQED) 
Some of the communities suing Dow and Shell have only a few hundred households, like Woodville in rural Tulare County. Ralph Gutierrez runs the water system here. 
“I’m the meter reader, I’m the sewer line cleaner, I do the budget,” says Gutierrez, grinning in his cowboy boots and Dodger hat. 
He unlocks the gate to show me one of the town’s two drinking water wells, surrounded by orchards and cow pastures. These wells serve a total of 467 households, and 1,2,3-TCP has been detected in the water at 7 parts per trillion, ten times the public health goal. 
“Dow and Shell are the ones that put this into the system,” Gutierrez says. “Obviously, they have money to attack their problems, but when you come to communities like this, they’re all farmworkers.” 
Gutierrez says there’s no way he can raise water rates high enough to pay for expensive carbon filtration to keep the carcinogen from reaching people’s taps. 
“I wouldn’t want my kids drinking it,” he says. “Would Dow Chemical or Shell like their people to be drinking this water? I don’t think so.” 
Results From My Tap 
Turns out the sample from my kitchen tap comes in at 2.2 parts per trillion. That’s three times the state public health goal for 1,2,3-TCP. “It’s been a high priority for us to develop regulations.” Cindy Forbes, State Water Resources Control Board 
OEHHA sets its goal to try to reduce the lifetime cancer risk to less than one in 1 million. So my risk is three in 1 million, over a lifetime drinking my tap water. 
Of course, my overall risk of getting cancer from any source is much higher; it’s more like one in three. Truth is, I should probably be more worried about secondhand smoke, or Fresno’s notoriously dirty air. 
But I’m not taking any chances with my kids. I’ve installed an undersink filter that says it takes out Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). But there’s no guarantee it takes out 1,2,3-TCP, because without a government standard, it’s not rated for that. 
State Regulation On Its Way 
Some water systems in the Central Valley have levels of 1,2,3-TCP that push the potential cancer risk to roughly one in 6,000. And a grassroots group called Community Water Center is pressuring the state to set a maximum contaminant level for the compound. That’s an enforceable standard, unlike the public health goal. 
Nearly 25 years after California declared 1,2,3-TCP to be a carcinogen, drinking water regulators are planning to set that level by next spring. 
“It’s been a high priority for us to develop regulations, but we have had so many other regulations with limited resources to work on, that we haven’t been able to get it over the finish line,” says Cindy Forbes, deputy director for the water board’s drinking water program. “There are a lot of pieces to setting a new maximum contaminant level.” 
Like conducting their own peer-reviewed science, taking public comment, and evaluating the cost of detection and cleanup — not just the health risks. 
“It’s our number one priority,” says Forbes. “It’s my priority, it’s the board’s priority.”

26,Overpumping groundwater increases contamination risk | Stanford News,Stanford University,2018-06-05,"June 5, 2018 Stanford researchers find groundwater pumping can increase arsenic levels in irrigation and drinking water Pumping an aquifer to the last drop squeezes out more than water. A Stanford study finds it can also unlock dangerous arsenic from buried clays – and reveals how sinking land can provide an early warning and measure of contamination. By Josie Garthwaite
For decades, intensive groundwater pumping has caused ground beneath California’s San Joaquin Valley to sink, damaging infrastructure. Now research published in the journal Nature Communications suggests that as pumping makes the ground sink, it also unleashes an invisible threat to human health and food production: It allows arsenic to move into groundwater aquifers that supply drinking water for 1 million people and irrigation for crops in some of the nation’s richest farmland. Groundwater is the main source of drinking water for 1 million people in California’s San Joaquin Valley, part of the arid Central Valley that supports a $17 billion agricultural industry. (Image credit: Shutterstock)
The group found that satellite-derived measurements of ground sinking could predict arsenic concentrations in groundwater. This technique could be an early warning system to prevent dangerous levels of arsenic contamination in aquifers with certain characteristics worldwide.
“Arsenic in groundwater has been a problem for a really long time,” said lead author Ryan Smith , a doctoral candidate in geophysics at the School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth). It’s naturally present in Earth’s crust and a frequent concern in groundwater management because of its ubiquity and links to heart disease, diabetes, cancer and other illnesses. “But the idea that overpumping for irrigation could increase arsenic concentrations is new,” Smith said.
Importantly, the group found signs that aquifers contaminated as a result of overpumping can recover if withdrawals stop. Areas that showed slower sinking compared to 15 years earlier also had lower arsenic levels. “Groundwater must have been largely turned over,” said study co-author Scott Fendorf , a professor of Earth system science and a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment . Releasing arsenic from clay
The research team analyzed arsenic data for hundreds of wells in two different drought periods alongside centimeter-level estimates of land subsidence, or sinking, captured by satellites. They found that when land in the San Joaquin Valley’s Tulare basin sinks faster than 3 inches per year, the risk of finding hazardous arsenic levels in groundwater as much as triples.
Aquifers in the Tulare basin are made up of sand and gravel zones separated by thin layers of clay. The clay acts like a sponge, holding tight to water as well as arsenic soaked up from ancient river sediments. Unlike the sand and gravel layers, these clays contain relatively little oxygen, which creates conditions for arsenic to be in a form that dissolves easily in water.
When pumping draws too much water from the sand and gravel areas, the aquifer compresses and land sinks. “Sands and gravels that were being propped apart by water pressure are now starting to squeeze down on that sponge,” Fendorf explained. Arsenic-rich water then starts to seep out and mix with water in the main aquifer.
When water pumping slows enough to put the brakes on subsidence – and relieve the squeeze on trapped arsenic – clean water soaking in from streams, rain and natural runoff at the surface can gradually flush the system clean.
However, study co-author Rosemary Knight , a professor of geophysics and affiliated faculty at the Woods Institute, warns against banking too much on a predictable recovery from overpumping. “How long it takes to recover is going to be highly variable and dependent upon so many factors,” she said.
The researchers said overpumping in other aquifers could produce the same contamination issues seen in the San Joaquin Valley if they have three attributes: alternating layers of clay and sand; a source of arsenic; and relatively low oxygen content, which is common in aquifers located beneath thick clays.
The threat may be more widespread than once thought. Only in the last few years have scientists discovered that otherwise well-aerated aquifers considered largely immune to arsenic problems can in fact be laced with clays that have the low oxygen levels necessary for arsenic to move into most groundwater. “We’re just starting to recognize that this is a danger,” said Fendorf. Satellite insights
The revelation that remote sensing can raise an alarm before contamination threatens human health offers hope for better water monitoring. “Instead of having to drill wells and take water samples back to the lab, we have a satellite getting the data we need,” said Knight.
While well data is important to validate and calibrate satellite data, she explained, on-the-ground monitoring can never match the breadth and speed of remote sensing. “You’re never sampling a well frequently enough to catch that arsenic the moment it’s in the well,” said Knight. “So how fantastic to have this remote sensing early warning system to let people realize that they’re approaching a critical point in terms of water quality.”
The study builds on research led in 2013 by Laura Erban, then a doctoral student working in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta. “That’s where we started saying, ‘Oh no,’” said Fendorf, who co-authored that paper.
As in the San Joaquin Valley, areas of the Mekong Delta where land was sinking more showed higher arsenic concentrations. “Now we have two sites in totally different geographic regions where the same mechanisms appear to be operating,” said Fendorf. “That sends a trigger that we need to be thinking about managing groundwater and making sure that we’re not overdrafting the aquifers.”
Scott Fendorf, the Terry Huffington Professor, is also senior associate dean for academic affairs and a member of the Stanford Child Health Research Institute . Rosemary Knight is the George L. Harrington Professor.

There is nothing more Californian than our ability to swim, surf and fish in clean water. And yet, we have fallen behind Kentucky and Texas when it comes to clean water enforcement. With industry advocates in the federal driver’s seat, we need state leaders in California to hold polluters accountable for harming our precious water resources. Most Popular Sanctuary split: While SF jail snubs ICE, Marin County does the opposite
Two years ago, I hiked the length of California and waded the Kern, Feather and San Joaquin rivers. At their beginnings, these waters are crystal clear, cold, flowing strong and clean. More than 40 years ago, Congress passed the Clean Water Act to protect these national treasures from pollution.
When California’s rivers leave the mountain snowmelt behind, they embark on a difficult journey. Many are diverted, drained and pumped dry before they reach the Pacific Ocean. Those that keep flowing are often polluted with heavy metals, pesticides, bacteria, plastic bottles and runoff from industrial operations. In fact, the number of California rivers that failed to meet basic water quality standards for swimming, fishing and drinking shot up 170 percent from 2006 to 2010 , (the last time our state undertook this legally required biannual task).

Like rules designed to prevent drunk driving, environmental laws are only as good as their enforcement. If police in some areas decided that being over the .08 percent blood alcohol level was not a big deal and didn’t issue penalties, we would see an increase in traffic deaths and the officers involved could lose their jobs. Unfortunately, this same scenario is playing out when it comes to actions against those polluting California’s waterways.
It used to be that the federal government was a cop on the beat enforcing the Clean Water Act . With the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency being subjected to a hostile takeover from polluting industries, the number of environmental enforcement cases and the amount of penalties levied has been cut in half .
At least under the Trump administration, California is going to have to go it alone. We are known internationally as a state that cares deeply about environmental protection, so you’d think we’d have this covered. California is suing the Trump administration to prevent rollbacks to vehicle emission standards. Frustratingly, this same vigor has not been applied to taking action against those polluting California’s beaches, bays and rivers.
The State Water Resources Control Board in Sacramento and the Regional Water Quality Control Boards are charged with protecting our increasingly scarce and precious water resources. These agencies helped us survive a devastating drought, but are falling short when it comes to levying fines against polluters. In 2016, only 1 percent of the illegal industrial and construction storm water pollution cases brought to the state water board resulted in penalties. Six of the nine regional water boards did not issue a single fine in 2016. In 2017, just 2 percent of industrial and construction storm water pollution cases brought to the state water board resulted in penalties. Related ",['Kern'],sfchronicle.com

29,Cancer-causing chemicals found in California farm water,Erin Elizabeth,2018-06-11,"Cancer-causing chemicals found in California farm water
Posted by Erin Elizabeth | Jun 11, 2018
During a recent test, high levels of the cancer-causing chemical 1,2,3 trichloropropane, also known as TCP, were found in wells located at two Arvin facilities (Grimmway Farms) in Kern County, California. According to the company, the levels at the facilities exceeded the state maximum level of 5 parts per trillion . This has potentially put around 1,500 employees in danger. 1 (The company is bringing in bottled water for employees to drink until the issue is solved.)
RELATED STORY: Monsanto sues California over weed killer cancer warnings
Joel Sherman, Grimmway’s vice president of safety and corporate affairs said:
“While the California State Water Resources Control Board does not consider the presence of TCP to be an emergency nor does it require the use of an alternative water supply, we have taken steps to ensure our employees at these facilities have access to unaffected drinking water. We are working closely with the state to resolve this issue in a timely manner.” 2
At this time it is unknown if the dangerous, tainted water was used to process carrots or other products at the facilities. And in fact, when Sherman was questioned to that fact he declined to answer saying that at this time the company was treating it only “as a drinking water issue.” 3
Dow and Shell Chemical used TCP in their pesticides in the 1970s and 80s (although they have stopped using the compound). But now the compound can be found in groundwater across the state- primarily in land used for agriculture.
(Note to self: Don’t buy any produce from them until they let people know if they are using water tainted with TCP for crops.)
“The wells were tested for TCP in March after state legislation was passed late last year requiring the testing and monitoring of the chemical, which can increase the chances of getting cancer and other illnesses if contaminated water is consumed over a long period of time.”
The water resources control board has jurisdiction over some wells at each of the affected facilities. According to Senior Sanitary Engineer Jesse Dhaliwal, at the Arvin freezer facility: one of the wells was found to have TCP levels of 165 parts per trillion (33 times the maximum level allowed by the state) a second well recorded 37 parts per trillion ( 7.5 times the allowed amount)
RELATED STORY: The next “Flint Water Crisis” in a small Michigan city – one company who dumped toxic waste
TCP levels are supposed to be tested every quarter and compliance is measured “by taking the total level and dividing it by four” (a violation occurs if any of the quarters have a level above 5 parts per trillion).
Dhaliwal said in the case of the Grimmway Farms facilities, all of the wells in the water board’s jurisdiction are in violation and that while they will receive a compliance order they will have three years to comply. (That’s utter nonsense. The amount of damage that can be done in three years time is staggering.)
However, this isn’t just a Kern County issue; TCP has become a major issue in the state with several cities, organizations, and companies finding high levels of the chemical in their water systems. Sources and References","['Kern', 'Arvin']",healthnutnews.com

31,The Nerve! Tulare County Supervisor Plagiarizes Rex Bohn's Well-Considered Argument in Favor of Taxes on Drinking Water,,2018-06-12,"Hank Sims / Yesterday @ 1:30 p.m. / Local Government The Nerve! Tulare County Supervisor Plagiarizes Rex Bohn’s Well-Considered Argument in Favor of Taxes on Drinking Water
Various movers and shakers around California spent the last few months engineering a scheme to tax the drinking water of everyone in the state. This plan — designed to fund a cleanup of Big Ag’s groundwater pollution in the Central Valley and elsewhere — died in the legislature yesterday , when it became clear that it wasn’t going to get the two-third supermajority that it required in the legislature.
Why should we tax everyone’s water to clean up the arsenic and other toxins that agribusiness pumps into the water table? Why shouldn’t, uh, agribusiness pay for it? It’s a question. The Bee , at the link above, quotes a state senator from Riverside who said that his constituents wouldn’t be too thrilled about having to kick in to fix other people’s problems.
“They’re going to spend a dollar a month to (go) where, Eureka?” said Sen. Richard Roth. “Nothing against Eureka, but I doubt people know where that is.”
Roth doesn’t know where it is, either — in fact, none of the municipal water in Humboldt County suffers from the problem the water tax was designed to solve. The poisoned municipal wells are almost all in the San Joaquin Valley and the like, where farmworkers pay for the water their employers have made undrinkable.
But the proposal is dead (for now) and that is all beside the point. You want to know what the point is? Rex Bohn, author.
The point is that our own Supervisor Rex Bohn, who now serves as the chairman of the Rural County Representatives of California — an inter-county “service organization” and schmoozefest — was all for the water tax, and was so all-for-it that he sat down and put quill to parchment, organizing his extensive research and his own insights in a tightly argued and persuasive essay the Times-Standard published on May 17 .
Check out this excerpt, which sounds extremely like Rex!
Too often, California residents who help produce our food can’t drink their own local water without getting sick and fearing serious illness. In over 300 communities across the state, contaminated water has forced schools to turn off faucets and residents to buy bottled water for drinking, cooking and washing.
A similar situation impacting families in our large cities or suburbs would ignite political upheaval. Emergencies would be declared. Solutions would be quickly forthcoming, regardless of the cost.
But in poorer, less populated regions of California, where water customers often rely on small water systems and private wells, the problem persists. Many smaller systems can’t afford to treat contaminated water.
Some who don’t know Supervisor Bohn very well might have been surprised to hear him advocate for new taxes — and on the very water we drink, of all things.
They might likewise have been surprised to hear him speak approvingly of “social justice and environmental groups,” as he does elsewhere in the essay, or to hear him use phrases like “quickly forthcoming,”“a bipartisan alignment of legislators” or “potentially transformative impact.” But as true Bros of Rex read along, they could hardly avoid hearing the man’s own voice narrating his words to them, like an audiobook of the mind, and they were undoubtedly won over. I haven’t seen any recent polling, but I assume everyone in the First District is now very much in support of lots and lots of new taxes on drinking water.
Wait a second, though! Looks like our money isn’t the only thing the Central Valley interests are after — they’re coming for our words, too! Here’s Kuyler Crocker, a supervisor from Tulare County and a fellow member of the Rural County Representatives of California, writing for gvwire.com at the end of last month :
Too often, residents who help produce our food can’t drink their own local water without getting sick fearing serious illness. In roughly 300 communities across the state, contaminated water has forced schools to turn off faucets and residents to buy bottled water for drinking, cooking and washing.

32,Too many Californians lack safe drinking water – op-ed co-authored by Secretary Ross urges legislature to take action,Office of Public Affairs,2018-06-04,"From the Sacramento Bee
By CDFA Secretary Karen Ross and California State Water Resources Control Board Chair Felicia Marcus
When we read about drinking water problems like those in Flint, Mich ., it’s easy to think that would never happen here. But the unfortunate fact is that many local water systems in California are failing to provide safe drinking water to their customers through no fault of their own.
In roughly 300 communities, from Trinidad to Tulare and Riverside to Oceanside, tap water has tested high for arsenic, nitrates, uranium and other chemicals that can cause learning disabilities, miscarriages, birth defects, and cancer. Right now, hundreds of thousands of Californians lack access to clean water for drinking, bathing and cooking. Children and the elderly are at the highest risk.
Since California passed the Human Right to Water Act in 2012 , the state has made some important strides to address this crisis. Using funds from Proposition 1 and other sources, we have provided hundreds of millions of dollars in grants and loans to help build new water treatment plants and other infrastructure in disadvantaged communities. And we’ve consolidated smaller systems in communities like East Porterville, where clean water now flows into hundreds of homes that were without it.
But despite years of effort, we still face a fundamental problem that stops us from helping many Californians. Many smaller water systems lack adequate resources to pay for ongoing operations and maintenance of modern treatment facilities. Bond funds and loans can’t be used to cover these costs, but without these resources, small systems don’t qualify for the funding that is available to cover the capital costs of these projects.
It is a Catch-22 that has created a world of water “haves” and “have nots” in the fifth largest economy in the world.
The Legislature has an opportunity to end this crisis once and for all. The governor’s proposed budget includes a new Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund created from fees on fertilizer, dairies and livestock, and a fee of less than a dollar a month assessed on water bills. A bipartisan and diverse alliance of farmers, disadvantaged communities, public health advocates and water systems supports the proposal – as do the vast majority of Californians according to a recent Water Foundation poll .
The new fund will create a modest state safety net to cover urgently needed updates to out-of-compliance water systems. It will facilitate the consolidation of small, financially struggling water systems with larger, more stable ones or with a group of communities that can find an economy of scale. And most critical, it will help cover ongoing water treatment costs, providing the last piece of the puzzle for small systems that are currently unable to get grants and loans and hire qualified managers.
Some people argue general fund dollars or enforcement fines should cover these costs. Let’s be clear: Existing funds would not provide the kind of multi-year funding guarantee needed to secure capital financing and maintain critical water infrastructure 24 hours a day. The proposed dedicated funding source will not compete with other general fund needs and will provide the state with essential infrastructure investment and public health protection over time.
Using fees to pay for the state’s basic needs makes good sense. We fund rural internet broadband service through fees on our cell phone bills and low-income heating and cooling assistance through fees on our gas and electric bills. The proposed drinking water fee of less than a dollar a month has the same clear connection to addressing a critical need – and costs even less.
As public servants, it is our job to champion the concerns of ordinary Californians and deliver life’s basic necessities. That is why we are urging members of California Legislature to approve the Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund this session.
Every month we fail to provide this funding is another month too many California families have to choose between buying bottled water and taking their chances with toxic taps. California can do better, but we need the right tools to do so.","['Porterville', 'Tulare']",ca.gov
33,Trump's EPA keeps Nazi nerve gas pesticide in use in California,,2018-01-08,"EPA keeps Nazi nerve gas pesticide in use in California's fields Thomas Elias Published 7:00 a.m. PT Jan. 8, 2018 Thomas Elias, Opinion Columnist (Photo: Record Searchlight) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE The outcry would be enormous if large numbers of farmers began using Zyklon B as a pesticide on fruits and vegetables. That was the nerve gas Nazi Germany used to execute 6 million Jews and millions of other victims in their notorious death camps. But there was little outcry except from environmentalists when the chief of President Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency late in 2017 decided to let U.S. farms continue using another nerve gas invented by the Nazis on crops as diverse as nuts, apples, broccoli, melons, citrus, corn and soybeans. German scientists didn’t invent the organophosphate chemical chlorpyrifos as a pesticide; rather they used it to gas Jews, gypsies and others they crammed into the airtight rear areas of mobile vans, a total of more than half a million persons. Trump is not alone in allowing manufacturers (primarily the Dow Chemical Co.) to keep selling the noxious substance to farmers and others. In fact, ex-President Barack Obama’s EPA didn’t move to prevent use of chlorpyrifos (pronounced klawr-peer-uh-fos). Obama’s EPA, though, did not claim the evidence against the substance was “insufficient” to declare it a health hazard, as current EPA head Scott Pruitt did. But the EPA under Obama did drag its feet, so much that in a 2015 hearing of the Ninth Circuit federal Court of Appeals, longtime appellate Judge Wallace Tashima scolded an EPA lawyer about the eight years it had by then taken the agency to work on a possible chlorpyrifos ban. “I think this is a pretty miserable record,” Tashima opined. The upshot is that chemical companies, not objective scientists, appear to control America’s pesticide regulation, no matter who is president. That became clear when a scientific panel of California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment last month voted unanimously to place the chemical on the list of dangerous substances under the 1986 Proposition 65. The panel included professors from UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Davis and Stanford, along with a scientist from the pharmaceutical firm Genentech. Proposition 65 hazard warnings usually are found on gasoline pumps and tanker trucks, not grocery shelves. But California farms now use more than 1 million pounds of chlorpyrifos yearly, about one-fourth of the national total, even if it is at lower concentrations than what Nazi executioners employed. Just last May, 50 farm workers exposed to its spraying near Bakersfield immediately suffered symptoms like vomiting, nausea and fainting. A 2016 EPA report found there are no safe uses of chlorpyrifos. All food exposure, the study said, is unsafe and there is no safe level in drinking water. The chemical is found at unsafe levels in schools, homes and widespread communities in agricultural areas like the Central Valley. In fields, unsafe levels continue 18 days after spraying. Ironically, this chemical also puts the lie to the old saying that “an apple a day keeps the doctor away.” For apples are one of the crops where chlorpyrifos is most commonly used. In California, it is used most heavily in Kern, Tulare and Monterey counties. A detailed 2016 study by Project TENDR, an independent group of academic scientists, found “Children in America…are at an unacceptably high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect the brain and nervous system, including autism, intellectual disabilities and … behavioral disabilities.” The pesticide puts children at risk for lower IQ, attention deficit disorders and childhood tremors, among other problems. Instead of using it, farmers could fight insect pests with botanically sourced pesticides including cinnamon oil and garlic oil. State officials report some have switched to another family of insecticides known as neonicitinoids. One problem: These substances threaten bees, even if they are easier on people. But no one has to make changes for now because of the Pruitt ruling. So children not only in California, but nationwide, may be endangered by eating foods their parents have good reason to believe healthy. That’s in part because studies show toxicity even at very low concentrations. The bottom line: Obama may have been slow dealing with the chlorpyrifos problem. But Trump and his appointee Pruitt make it clear they don’t even see a problem. Email Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com.

Missing grandmother and two children confirmed dead
A family friend has confirmed that Melody Bledsoe and her two grandchildren died in the Carr Fire, bringing the death toll from the blaze to five.
Only seven wildfires in California history have killed more than five people, according to data from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Bledsoe was babysitting her great-grandson and great-granddaughter in Keswick Dam Road and Quartz Hill Drive, just outside Redding.
Donald Kewley, 28, whose number was listed on a Facebook post about the three being missing that went viral, said Saturday he was consoling Bledsoe's husband, and the family had just returned from the Shasta County Coroner's Office.
The children are identified as 5-year-old James Roberts and 4-year-old Emily Roberts, according to a post shared on Facebook after they went missing. Sheriff Tom Bosenko said the bodies have not been recovered, but there is evidence people died in the house.
The house was consumed by fire, the roof collapsed and it has covered the footprint of the house, which is preventing officials from getting inside, Bosenko said.
“Just spoke with my staff at the scene,” Bosenko said. “There is overwhelming evidence that there are decedents at the scene and that they have communicated that with family members.”
The fire was moving so quickly when it ripped through the area that it was overtaking firefighters, Bosenko said. Kewley said they're worried about other people whose families are missing as well.
""We're trying to call, and we're trying to beat the news,"" he said.
Police on Saturday had gone to the home on a welfare check. At the time they said they had not seen evidence anyone was dead, but they were investigating it.
Redding Fire inspector Jeremy Stoke was killed in the fire Thursday night, while Don Ray Smith, 81, of Pollock Pines was identified on Saturday as the man killed while he operated a bulldozer.
Coroner’s officials said Smith was overtaken by the fire on Thursday and his body was found in the area of Benson Drive and Rock Creek Road in Shasta, about 3 miles east of Whiskeytown National Recreation Area. His body was found by emergency personnel.

At the morning briefing Saturday at the Shasta District Fairgrounds in Anderson, fire officials said the blaze is expected to pick up significantly around 1 p.m., based on weather forecasts.
Air attack was scheduled to begin at 8:30 a.m. with planes in the northwest part of the fire, which is burning in less populated areas. A fire commander said helicopters would go up as early as possible. Conditions have limited the amount of air support that can be used.
Unified Incident Commander Brett Gouvea reminded the assembled leadership group that they are in a “marathon” situation.
He did, however, say Friday night was “ a more favorable night in comparison to the two nights prior to that.

Gouvea called the events of Thursday night “historic and unprecedented.”
Commanders also talked Saturday morning of “boxing in” the fire in the areas where it remains on the move, and cited four specific areas where they want to hold it.
Fire officials were told to expect the fire to pick up about 1 p.m.
In the most populated areas, the goal is to keep the fire:

35,Fracking Lawsuit: California Sues Trump Administration | Patch,,2018-01-25,"politics & government Shared from the San Francisco, CA Patch Fracking Lawsuit: California Sues Trump Administration ""The agency has abdicated its responsibility under federal law to manage these lands for the good of the public."" Jan 25, 2018 1:20 pm ET | Updated 0 
SAN FRANCISCO, CA — The state of California and a coalition of environmental groups both sued the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in federal court in San Francisco on Wednesday to challenge the repeal of a 2015 rule regulating fracking. 
The two lawsuits claim the bureau violated several laws by failing to provide a reasoned basis for its action and failing to prepare an adequate environmental review. 
""The agency has abdicated its responsibility under federal law to manage these lands for the good of the public, not just for fracking companies,"" said Michael Freeman, a lawyer for the Sierra Club and other environmental groups. 
The bureau's action ""is devoid of any reasoned analysis, contravenes BLM's statutory mandates and ignores significant environmental consequences,"" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra wrote in the state's lawsuit. 
>>Also See: Please Don't Help My Kids 
Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is the practice of directing high-pressure streams of water, sand and chemicals at underground rock formations to fracture the rock and release oil and natural gas. 
Advocates of fracking say it can help to meet the nation's energy needs, while opponents claim it contaminates groundwater used as drinking water, creates air pollution and increases earthquake risks. 
The 2015 rule developed by the BLM under the administration of President Barack Obama applied to federal and tribal lands. It mandated public disclosure of the chemicals used, required operators to store fracking waste fluid in above-ground tanks rather than underground pits, and set standards for oil and gas wells to protect groundwater.

The rule never went into effect because it was blocked by a federal judge in Wyoming after being challenged by industry groups and four oil-producing states. 
On March 28, 2017, President Donald Trump ordered the bureau to repeal or revise the rule, and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke began the repeal process the next day. The repeal was completed on Dec. 29. 
The lawsuits allege the bureau violated several federal land-management laws that require it to safeguard the public welfare and the environment on public lands. 
They also claim it violated the Administrative Procedures Act, which prohibits arbitrary and capricious agency actions and has been interpreted by the courts to require ""reasoned analysis."" 
Finally, the two suits also allege the bureau should have conducted a full Environmental Impact Statement under the National Environmental Policy Act. 
The bureau is part of the Interior Department and Zinke is also named as a defendant. The agency oversees 15 million acres of public land in California, about 15 percent of the state's land mass, the lawsuits say. 
The Sierra Club and the other environmental groups filed a motion Wednesday asking the court to consolidate their lawsuit with the state's. The lawsuits ask the court to order the 2015 rule reinstated. 
Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman Megan Crandall said the agency does not comment on matters concerning pending litigation. 
At the time of the repeal, the bureau said it had concluded that the 2015 rule imposed unjustified administrative burdens and that all 32 states with federal oil and gas leases had state regulations covering fracking. It said the federal rule had a compliance cost of up to $9,690 per well. 
The two lawsuits say that some states don't have strong enough regulations. California says in its suit that its regulations are similar to those in the now-rescinded federal rule, but the federal rule contained some additional provisions protecting the environment and public health.

SANTA MONICA, Calif. , Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Consumer Watchdog urged Governor Jerry Brown to direct state oil regulators to publicly post all oil well leaks in the state after learning that the state is tracking all spills from wells of oil, drilling fluids, and toxic water but not disclosing them. 
""We write you today to ask you to immediately order the Department of Conservation and its Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) to publicly post on its website an accurate list of all known surface expressions (i.e. oil leaks) in the State of California by oil-producing county,"" wrote Consumer Watchdog advocate Liza Tucker . 
Consumer Watchdog filed a Public Records Act request with oil regulators on February 9 but has received no response. For the letter to Brown, and attachments documenting Kern County leaks, see here. 
""It has come to our attention that in Kern County alone, DOGGR has identified 185 leaks tracked between 2012 and January 11, 2018 . Moreover, 35 of these leaks occurred because of damage to well casings at shallow depths where aquifers are often located. 
""It is critically important for the public, lawmakers, and experts to accurately and on a timely basis track such leaks in real time in order to ascertain their number and extent, whether each leak is under control, and whether their number is increasing or decreasing over time in order to better protect the environment and public health. 
""The data shared with us raise serious questions about the extent of surface expressions in other oil producing counties, particularly Santa Barbara County and Los Angeles County where many urbanites live just feet from drilling operations. The only rational conclusion to be drawn from the deliberate nondisclosure of this surface expression data is that your Department of Conservation is helping to shield oil company profits, which come firmly before public health on the part of oil regulators."" 
Consumer Watchdog sent the letter to Brown on the heels of a recommendation by the Los Angeles Department of Public Health calling for more protections for residents living in close proximity to thousands of toxic oil and gas wells in low-income neighborhoods. The wells ""present public health concerns, ranging from respiratory health effects to development of cancer,"" the county reported, according to the Daily News. The county requires a 300-foot setback, but the report recommends increasing that to 1,500 feet. 
In addition, the Stockholm Institute on the Environment (SEI) released analysis today showing that action to stem California oil production, something that Governor Jerry Brown has resisted, would have critical health and climate benefits. ""The Stockholm Environment Institute makes a strong case that Governor Jerry Brown cannot support full-throttle oil and gas production while claiming that emissions can be cut substantially enough via energy efficiency, carbon trading, and renewable energy to avoid the 'existential threat' of climate change,"" said Tucker. ""We have to start leaving oil in the ground."" 
The report finds that, contrary to previous claims, every barrel of California oil left in the ground will also result in a net decrease in oil production globally.

38,Public Health Campaign Says Dollar General's Illegal Hazardous Waste Treatment is Another Example of Careless Corporate Behavior Endangering Communities,,2017-04-20,"SAN DIEGO , April 19, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Yesterday, California district attorneys announced that a Kern County judge has ordered the Tennessee -based discount retailer Dollar General to pay $1.12 million in civil penalties for ""routinely and systematically"" violating the law by sending hazardous waste to local landfills. Representatives of the Campaign for Healthier Solutions , which works to address the public health impacts of toxic chemicals found in some dollar store products, issued the following statements in response:
Jose Bravo , Coordinator of the Campaign for Healthier Solutions, said, ""Dollar General repeatedly and systematically polluted the environment and endangered people until getting caught by an undercover investigation, and they are just now saying they will put together an internal policy to correct this problem? Wow--what happened to common sense or corporate responsibility? We urge Dollar General to clean up their act and advance a comprehensive hazardous chemicals policy that addresses dangerous substances in their products, and which protects the environment and the health and safety of their workers.""
Suguet Lopez, Executive Director of Lideres Campesinas , said, ""We've known that communities in the central valley of California already face many sources of exposure to toxic chemicals--including pesticide exposure, drinking water contaminated by oil and gas operations, and diesel emissions. In the past, our testing found that Dollar General products may expose customers and their children to potentially dangerous chemicals, and now we find that Dollar General has also been contaminating our local communities. We truly appreciate California's district attorneys for seeking justice, but what happened to Dollar General's claim of being a responsible corporation?""
Pam Tau Lee, retired program coordinator of the Labor Occupational Health Program at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health and a member Grassroots Global Justice , said, ""During the inspection regulators also found employee hazardous waste training to be inaccurate or incomplete. A review of Dollar General's OSHA workplace violations shows that this company has repeatedly violated worker health and safety standards--amounting to over $2 million in fines. 'Environmental Justice' affirms the right of all workers to a safe and healthy work environment, without being forced to choose between an unsafe livelihood and unemployment--which also puts their lives at risk for chronic diseases including cancer. While declaring themselves a 'responsible corporation', these repeated violations demonstrate that the community needs to stay vigilant as Dollar General's health and safety practices have repeatedly put the community and workers' health at risk.""
The Campaign for Healthier Solutions is a coalition of over 100 grassroots, environmental justice, public health and community organizations calling on dollar stores to protect their customers by adopting or strengthening their comprehensive toxic chemical policies (as other major retailers have done ).

39,Public Interest Groups Urge Senate To Deny Gov’s Point Man Confirmation To PUC After He Fired Tough,Consumer Watchdog,2017-05-04,"SANTA MONICA, Calif. , May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Public interest advocacy groups Consumer Watchdog, Food & Water Watch, Rootskeeper, Save Porter Ranch, and public interest attorneys Aguirre & Severson LLP, have urged the Senate Rules Committee not to confirm former aide to Governor Jerry Brown , Cliff Rechtschaffen , to the California Public Utilities Commission.  Rechtschaffen has record of ignoring federal laws and state regulations to aid the oil and gas industry while jeopardizing the environment and public health.
""Rechtschaffen's record shows that he will pander to the largest energy companies in the state at great expense to the public, to the proper role of government, and to fair play,"" the groups wrote to the Senate Rules Committee. 
""Rechtschaffen's dismissal of tough oil and gas regulators in the state on behalf of one of its largest oil companies is one of the saddest chapters in this state's unapologetic obeisance to Big Oil,"" the letter said. ""It should not go without full and complete public disclosure in the confirmation process and thorough questioning of Mr. Rechtschaffen about details yet to be in the public record.""
To read the letter, see:
http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/cliffrechtschaffenopposeltrfinal5-3-17.pdf 
Cliff Rechtschaffen fired two top oil and gas regulators in 2011, after Occidental Petroleum and its attorney, former Governor Gray Davis , pressured Governor Jerry Brown to speed up the granting of oil industry permits without proper environmental review. His actions, and subsequent restructuring of the Department of Conservation's Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR), eventually led to the drilling of more than 2,400 oilfield wastewater disposal wells into federally protected aquifers. In the wake of the firings, and granting of a Kern County fracking permit, Occidental contributed a total of $500,000 to Proposition 103, Brown's initiative to raise taxes. 
Rechtschaffen's actions deep-sixed emergency regulations that the fired regulators were drafting to improve the safety of cyclic steaming, a common method of hydraulic fracturing. Cyclic steaming in wells with damaged casings can affect nearby wells and open up sinkholes like one in which a Chevron worker had died earlier in 2011. ""Without the regulations in place, oil companies carried on the dangerous practice of cyclic steaming without having to report everything from well pressures and conditions to proper posting of when and where cyclic steaming was taking place,"" the letter said. ""By undermining well rules as the Governor's point person on oil and gas issues, Rechtschaffen put public health and safety at risk.""
In reviewing Rechtschaffen's record, the letter also raised questions about:
Rechtschaffen's role in the largest methane well blowout in US history at Aliso Canyon, the natural gas reserve owned by Southern California Edison and parent, Sempra. ""Rechtschaffen's ignoring of DOGGR standards may have directly led to the failure of injection well SS 25 in Aliso Canyon,"" the letter said. The letter also questioned his role in Governor Jerry Brown's emergency proclamation on Aliso Canyon in 2016. ""That proclamation swept aside any public investigation into the causes of the blowout that only the PUC has the authority to open, and gave SoCalGas direct cover to hire and direct consultants to determine the cause of the debacle, and to control when and what the public learns about it. As Brown's trusted energy advisor, Rechtschaffen would have had to be a party to the proclamation's nuances."" 
Rechtschaffen's role in rolling California into a larger Western regional electric grid, which he has championed. ""The push to fold California into a Western grid risks opening it up to imports of dirty coal power from Warren Buffett's PacifiCorp, which owns more coal-fired power plants than any other US company, and also subjects California to the same possible swindle of consumers and the environment as we had during the California electricity crisis caused by a thoroughly discredited experiment in deregulation at the turn of the century,"" the letter said. ""A regional grid puts the system into the regulatory hands of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, taking away the state's ability to control its own energy destiny."" The letter concluded: ""It is vital that any commissioner appointed to the PUC bring a strong record of acting in the public interest, and not of acting on behalf of industry, be it oil and gas producers, or investor-owned utilities pushing fossil fuels at the expense of ratepayers and the public health. Cliff Rechtschaffen has no such demonstrated record. For all the above-explained reasons, we urge you not to confirm Rechtschaffen to the PUC.""

40,Public Interest Groups Urge CA Senate To Deny Gov's Point Man Confirmation To PUC After He Fired Tough Oil Well Safety Regulators & Weakened Safety Rules,,2017-08-23,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. , Aug. 23, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Public interest groups are urging the California Senate Rules Committee to demand answers about oil and gas well safety breaches from Governor Brown's top oil and gas aide and to not confirm him to the Public Utilities Commission without them.
The groups called upon Senate leader Kevin de Leon and the Committee not to confirm Cliff Rechtschaffen unless he could adequately explain why he fired tough oil well regulators and weakened well safety standards, at the behest of Occidental Petroleum, leading to many safety scandals, including the Aliso Canyon methane leak.
The groups stated that the reopening of the Aliso natural gas reserve recently, without any public release of findings about the cause of the largest methane leak in US history, brings even more import to de Leon's rejection of Rechtschaffen's confirmation.
Consumer Watchdog, Food & Water Watch, Rootskeeper, Save Porter Ranch, and public interest attorneys Aguirre & Severson LLP wrote to de Leon that Rechtschaffen has a record of ignoring federal laws and state regulations to aid the oil and gas industry while jeopardizing the environment and public health.
""Rechtschaffen's record shows that he will pander to the largest energy companies in the state at great expense to the public, to the proper role of government, and to fair play,"" the groups wrote.

Cliff Rechtschaffen fired two top oil and gas regulators in 2011, after Occidental Petroleum and its attorney, former Governor Gray Davis , pressured Governor Jerry Brown to speed up the granting of oil industry permits without proper environmental review, according to court papers. His actions, and subsequent restructuring of the Department of Conservation's Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR), eventually led to the drilling of more than 2,400 oilfield wastewater disposal wells into federally protected aquifers. In the wake of the firings, and granting of a Kern County fracking permit, Occidental contributed a total of $500,000 to Proposition 30, Brown's initiative to raise taxes.
Rechtschaffen's actions killed emergency regulations that the fired regulators were drafting to improve the safety of cyclic steaming, a common method of hydraulic fracturing. Cyclic steaming in wells with damaged casings can affect nearby wells and open up sinkholes like one in which a Chevron worker had died earlier in 2011.

""By undermining well rules as the Governor's point person on oil and gas issues, Rechtschaffen put public health and safety at risk.""
The letter raised many questions about Rechtschaffen's role in the blowout at Aliso Canyon, the natural gas reserve owned by Southern California Edison and parent Sempra.  Kathleen Brown , Jerry Brown's sister, sits on the board of Sempra and made more than $1 million for her board work there since taking the office two years into Brown's gubernatorial term.
""Rechtschaffen's ignoring of DOGGR standards may have directly led to the failure of injection well SS 25 in Aliso Canyon,"" the letter said.
The letter also raised red flags about Rechtschaffen's role in Governor Jerry Brown's emergency proclamation on Aliso Canyon in 2016. ""That proclamation swept aside any public investigation into the causes of the blowout that only the PUC has the authority to open, and gave SoCalGas direct cover to hire and direct consultants to determine the cause of the debacle, and to control when and what the public learns about it. As Brown's trusted energy advisor, Rechtschaffen would have had to be a party to the proclamation's nuances.""
Families in Porter Ranch and the Northern San Fernando Valley who have been sickened by the Aliso Canyon blowout are up in arms about the nomination of Rechtschaffen traveled to Sacramento to testify that he does not belong on the panel that regulates utilities. They say Rechtschaffen ignored regulations that could have avoided the 2015 Aliso Canyon Gas Storage facility blowout that released 100,000 tons of methane into the air. 
Alex Kim , who emigrated from Korea in the mid-1970's, says he hadn't protested since his student days in Seoul but has been forced to speak out because his wife suffers ongoing nosebleeds and his grandchild suffered rashes which he attributes to the blowout. 
Melanie Demont is a retired school teacher who was forced to evacuate for months until the leak was capped. Like many residents near the gas fields, she has ended up in the ER and urgent care with respiratory symptoms. 
""The blowout at Aliso Canyon has changed my life in ways I never would have imagined,"" said Demont. ""My ongoing health problems have me considering whether to sell the house that was supposed to be my retirement, because I can't live somewhere I can't breathe. Cliff Rechtschaffen is responsible for shutting down well safety rules that could have prevented this disaster that has ruined my life. That's why I'm traveling to Sacramento to plead with the Senate to reject his confirmation to the PUC. We deserve better.""
Consumer President Jamie Court wrote de Leon yesterday to point out that just because he and Brown are both Democrats there should be no favoritism towards Rechtschaffen.  
""Appointees and governors must know that when they do harm to the public and the public interest they will be questioned and not confirmed if their answers are not satisfactory,"" Court said.  ""Governor Brown holds huge power in this state but he is not a king and the Senate must not treat his appointees as though he were.""
To read Court's letter see: http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/sites/default/files/ltrkdl8-21-18.pdf 
The public interest groups' letter also called into question Rechtschaffen's role in rolling California into a larger Western regional electric. 
""The push to fold California into a Western grid risks opening it up to imports of dirty coal power from Warren Buffett's PacifiCorp, which owns more coal-fired power plants than any other US company, and also subjects California to the same possible swindle of consumers and the environment as we had during the California electricity crisis caused by a thoroughly discredited experiment in deregulation at the turn of the century,"" the letter said.

In the past, our testing found that Dollar General products may expose customers and their children to potentially dangerous chemicals, and now we find that Dollar General has also been contaminating our local communities. We truly appreciate California's district attorneys for seeking justice, but what happened to Dollar General's claim of being a responsible corporation?"" 
Pam Tau Lee, retired program coordinator of the Labor Occupational Health Program at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health and a member Grassroots Global Justice , said, ""During the inspection regulators also found employee hazardous waste training to be inaccurate or incomplete. A review of Dollar General's OSHA workplace violations shows that this company has repeatedly violated worker health and safety standards--amounting to over $2 million in fines. 'Environmental Justice' affirms the right of all workers to a safe and healthy work environment, without being forced to choose between an unsafe livelihood and unemployment--which also puts their lives at risk for chronic diseases including cancer. While declaring themselves a 'responsible corporation', these repeated violations demonstrate that the community needs to stay vigilant as Dollar General's health and safety practices have repeatedly put the community and workers' health at risk."" 
The Campaign for Healthier Solutions is a coalition of over 100 grassroots, environmental justice, public health and community organizations calling on dollar stores to protect their customers by adopting or strengthening their comprehensive toxic chemical policies (as other major retailers have done ).

43,Public Interest Groups Urge CA Senate To Deny Gov's Point Man Confirmation To PUC After He Fired Tough Oil Well Safety Regulators & Weakened Safety Rules,,2017-08-23,"By: Consumer Watchdog via PR Newswire  36 PM EDT Public Interest Groups Urge CA Senate To Deny Gov's Point Man Confirmation To PUC After He Fired Tough Oil Well Safety Regulators & Weakened Safety Rules 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. , Aug. 23, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Public interest groups are urging the California Senate Rules Committee to demand answers about oil and gas well safety breaches from Governor Brown's top oil and gas aide and to not confirm him to the Public Utilities Commission without them. 
The groups called upon Senate leader Kevin de Leon and the Committee not to confirm Cliff Rechtschaffen unless he could adequately explain why he fired tough oil well regulators and weakened well safety standards, at the behest of Occidental Petroleum, leading to many safety scandals, including the Aliso Canyon methane leak. 
The groups stated that the reopening of the Aliso natural gas reserve recently, without any public release of findings about the cause of the largest methane leak in US history, brings even more import to de Leon's rejection of Rechtschaffen's confirmation. 
Consumer Watchdog, Food & Water Watch, Rootskeeper, Save Porter Ranch, and public interest attorneys Aguirre & Severson LLP wrote to de Leon that Rechtschaffen has a record of ignoring federal laws and state regulations to aid the oil and gas industry while jeopardizing the environment and public health. 
""Rechtschaffen's record shows that he will pander to the largest energy companies in the state at great expense to the public, to the proper role of government, and to fair play,"" the groups wrote. 
To read the full letter, see: http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/cliffrechtschaffenopposeltrfinal5-3-17.pdf 
""Rechtschaffen's dismissal of tough oil and gas regulators in the state on behalf of one of its largest oil companies is one of the saddest chapters in this state's unapologetic obeisance to Big Oil,"" the letter said. ""It should not go without full and complete public disclosure in the confirmation process and thorough questioning of Mr. Rechtschaffen about details yet to be in the public record."" 
Cliff Rechtschaffen fired two top oil and gas regulators in 2011, after Occidental Petroleum and its attorney, former Governor Gray Davis , pressured Governor Jerry Brown to speed up the granting of oil industry permits without proper environmental review, according to court papers. His actions, and subsequent restructuring of the Department of Conservation's Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR), eventually led to the drilling of more than 2,400 oilfield wastewater disposal wells into federally protected aquifers. In the wake of the firings, and granting of a Kern County fracking permit, Occidental contributed a total of $500,000 to Proposition 30, Brown's initiative to raise taxes. 
Rechtschaffen's actions killed emergency regulations that the fired regulators were drafting to improve the safety of cyclic steaming, a common method of hydraulic fracturing. Cyclic steaming in wells with damaged casings can affect nearby wells and open up sinkholes like one in which a Chevron worker had died earlier in 2011. 
""Without the regulations in place, oil companies carried on the dangerous practice of cyclic steaming without having to report everything from well pressures and conditions to proper posting of when and where cyclic steaming was taking place,"" the letter said. ""By undermining well rules as the Governor's point person on oil and gas issues, Rechtschaffen put public health and safety at risk."" 
The letter raised many questions about Rechtschaffen's role in the blowout at Aliso Canyon, the natural gas reserve owned by Southern California Edison and parent Sempra. Kathleen Brown , Jerry Brown's sister, sits on the board of Sempra and made more than $1 million for her board work there since taking the office two years into Brown's gubernatorial term. 
""Rechtschaffen's ignoring of DOGGR standards may have directly led to the failure of injection well SS 25 in Aliso Canyon,"" the letter said. 
The letter also raised red flags about Rechtschaffen's role in Governor Jerry Brown's emergency proclamation on Aliso Canyon in 2016. ""That proclamation swept aside any public investigation into the causes of the blowout that only the PUC has the authority to open, and gave SoCalGas direct cover to hire and direct consultants to determine the cause of the debacle, and to control when and what the public learns about it. As Brown's trusted energy advisor, Rechtschaffen would have had to be a party to the proclamation's nuances."" 
Families in Porter Ranch and the Northern San Fernando Valley who have been sickened by the Aliso Canyon blowout are up in arms about the nomination of Rechtschaffen traveled to Sacramento to testify that he does not belong on the panel that regulates utilities. They say Rechtschaffen ignored regulations that could have avoided the 2015 Aliso Canyon Gas Storage facility blowout that released 100,000 tons of methane into the air. 
Alex Kim , who emigrated from Korea in the mid-1970's, says he hadn't protested since his student days in Seoul but has been forced to speak out because his wife suffers ongoing nosebleeds and his grandchild suffered rashes which he attributes to the blowout. 
Melanie Demont is a retired school teacher who was forced to evacuate for months until the leak was capped. Like many residents near the gas fields, she has ended up in the ER and urgent care with respiratory symptoms. 
""The blowout at Aliso Canyon has changed my life in ways I never would have imagined,"" said Demont. ""My ongoing health problems have me considering whether to sell the house that was supposed to be my retirement, because I can't live somewhere I can't breathe. Cliff Rechtschaffen is responsible for shutting down well safety rules that could have prevented this disaster that has ruined my life. That's why I'm traveling to Sacramento to plead with the Senate to reject his confirmation to the PUC. We deserve better."" 
Consumer President Jamie Court wrote de Leon yesterday to point out that just because he and Brown are both Democrats there should be no favoritism towards Rechtschaffen. 
""Appointees and governors must know that when they do harm to the public and the public interest they will be questioned and not confirmed if their answers are not satisfactory,"" Court said. ""Governor Brown holds huge power in this state but he is not a king and the Senate must not treat his appointees as though he were."" 
To read Court's letter see: http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/sites/default/files/ltrkdl8-21-18.pdf 
The public interest groups' letter also called into question Rechtschaffen's role in rolling California into a larger Western regional electric. 
""The push to fold California into a Western grid risks opening it up to imports of dirty coal power from Warren Buffett's PacifiCorp, which owns more coal-fired power plants than any other US company, and also subjects California to the same possible swindle of consumers and the environment as we had during the California electricity crisis caused by a thoroughly discredited experiment in deregulation at the turn of the century,"" the letter said. ""A regional grid puts the system into the regulatory hands of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, taking away the state's ability to control its own energy destiny."" 
The letter concluded: ""It is vital that any commissioner appointed to the PUC bring a strong record of acting in the public interest, and not of acting on behalf of industry, be it oil and gas producers, or investor-owned utilities pushing fossil fuels at the expense of ratepayers and the public health. Cliff Rechtschaffen has no such demonstrated record. For all the above-explained reasons, we urge you not to confirm Rechtschaffen to the PUC.""",['Kern'],financialcontent.com
44,Phase III Data Showed That Venclexta Plus Rituxan Helped People With Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Live Longer Without Their Disease Worsening Compared to Bendamustine Plus Rituxan,,2017-09-18,"By: Genentech via Business Wire News Releases September 18, 2017 at 11:30 AM EDT Phase III Data Showed That Venclexta Plus Rituxan Helped People With Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Live Longer Without Their Disease Worsening Compared to Bendamustine Plus Rituxan Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), announced today that the Phase III MURANO study, which evaluated Venclexta™ (venetoclax) in combination with Rituxan® (rituximab) in people with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in the time people lived without their disease progressing (progression-free survival [PFS] as assessed by investigator) when treated with Venclexta plus Rituxan compared to bendamustine plus Rituxan. No new safety signals or increase in known toxicities of Venclexta were observed with the treatment combination of Venclexta plus Rituxan. Venclexta is being developed by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. It is jointly commercialized by the companies in the United States and commercialized by AbbVie outside of the United States. 
Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY ), announced today that the PhaseIII MURANO study, which evaluated Venclexta ™ (venetoclax) in combination with Rituxan ® (rituximab) in people with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in the time people lived without their disease progressing (progression-free survival [PFS] as assessed by investigator) when treated with Venclexta plus Rituxan compared to bendamustine plus Rituxan. No new safety signals or increase in known toxicities of Venclexta were observed with the treatment combination of Venclexta plus Rituxan. Venclexta is being developed by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. It is jointly commercialized by the companies in the United States and commercialized by AbbVie outside of the United States. 
“Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is considered incurable and becomes harder to treat with each relapse,” said Sandra Horning, M.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “This is the first study to show that Venclexta plus Rituxan can help people with this type of leukemia live significantly longer without their disease worsening compared to a standard-of-care regimen. We will work with health authorities to bring this potential chemotherapy-free treatment option to the people who need it as quickly as possible.” 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Venclexta in combination with Rituxan for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL based on promising results from the PhaseIb M13-365 study. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of medicines with early evidence of potential clinical benefit in serious or life-threatening diseases and to help ensure that patients receive access to medicines as soon as possible. 
Venclexta was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in April 2016 for the treatment of people with CLL with 17p deletion, as detected by an FDA approved test, who have received at least one prior therapy. The MURANO study is part of the company’s commitment in the United States to convert the current accelerated approval of Venclexta to a full approval. Data from the MURANO study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to global health authorities. 
About the MURANO study 
MURANO (NCT02005471) is a PhaseIII open-label, international, multicenter, randomized study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Venclexta in combination with Rituxan compared with bendamustine in combination with Rituxan. All treatments were of fixed duration. The study included 389 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL who had been previously treated with at least one but not more than three lines of therapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Venclexta plus Rituxan (Arm A) or bendamustine plus Rituxan (Arm B). The primary endpoint of the study is investigator-assessed PFS. Secondary endpoints include PFS assessed by independent review committee (IRC), best overall response, complete response, duration of response, overall survival, event-free survival, time to next CLL treatment and minimal residual disease (MRD) status. 
About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) 
CLL is the most common type of adult leukemia, and in 2017, it is estimated there will be more than 20,000 new cases of CLL diagnosed in the United States. Although signs of CLL may disappear for a period of time after initial treatment, the disease is considered incurable and many people will require additional treatment due to the return of cancerous cells. 
About Venclexta 
Venclexta is a small molecule designed to selectively bind and inhibit the BCL-2 protein, which plays an important role in a process called apoptosis (programmed cell death). Overexpression of the BCL-2 protein in CLL has been associated with resistance to certain therapies. It is believed that blocking BCL-2 may restore the signaling system that tells cells, including cancer cells, to self-destruct. Venclexta is being developed by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. It is jointly commercialized by the companies in the United States and commercialized by AbbVie outside of the United States. 
Together, the companies are committed to further research with Venclexta, which is currently being evaluated in PhaseIII clinical trials for the treatment of CLL, along with studies in several other types of cancers. In the United States, Venclexta has been granted four breakthrough therapy designations by the FDA: in combination with Rituxan for people with relapsed or refractory CLL; as a monotherapy for people with relapsed or refractory CLL with 17p deletion; in combination with hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine) for people with untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) ineligible for intensive chemotherapy; and in combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) for people with untreated AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. 
Venclexta Indication 
Venclexta ™ (venetoclax) is a prescription medicine used to treat people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with 17p deletion who have received at least one prior treatment. 
Venclexta was approved based on response rate. There is an ongoing study to find out how Venclexta works over a longer period of time. 
It is not known if Venclexta is safe and effective in children. 
Important Safety Information 
Patients must tell their doctor right away about any side effects they experience. 
Venclexta can cause serious side effects, including tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. TLS can cause kidney failure, the need for dialysis treatment, and may lead to death. A patient’s doctor will do tests for TLS. It is important for patients taking Venclexta to keep their appointments for blood tests. Patients will receive other medicines before starting and during treatment with Venclexta to help reduce their risk of TLS. Patients may also need to receive intravenous (IV) fluids into their vein. Patients taking Venclexta should tell their doctor right away if they have any symptoms of TLS during treatment with Venclexta, including fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, confusion, shortness of breath, seizures, irregular heartbeat, dark or cloudy urine, unusual tiredness or muscle pain or joint pain. 
Patients should drink plenty of water when taking Venclexta to help reduce the risk of getting TLS. Patients should drink 6 to 8 glasses (about 56 ounces total) of water each day, starting 2 days before their first dose, on the day of their first dose of Venclexta, and each time the dose is increased. 
Certain medicines must not be taken when patients first start taking Venclexta and while their dose is being slowly increased. Patients should tell their doctor about all the medicines they take , including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Venclexta and other medicines may affect each other, causing serious side effects. Patients should not start new medicines during treatment with Venclexta without first talking with their doctor. 
Before taking Venclexta, patients should tell their doctor about all of their medical conditions, including if they: Have any kidney or liver problems. Have problems with their body salts or electrolytes, such as potassium, phosphorus, or calcium. Have a history of high uric acid levels in their blood or gout. Are scheduled to receive a vaccine. Patients should not receive a “live vaccine” before, during, or after treatment with Venclexta, until their doctor tells them it is okay. If a patient is unsure about the type of immunization or vaccine, they should ask their doctor. These vaccines may not be safe or may not work as well during treatment with Venclexta. Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Venclexta may harm an unborn baby. If a patient is able to become pregnant, the doctor should do a pregnancy test before they start treatment with Venclexta, and they should use effective birth control during treatment and for 30 days after the last dose of Venclexta. Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if Venclexta passes into breast milk. Patients should not breastfeed during treatment with Venclexta. 
Patients taking Venclexta should not drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit, Seville oranges (often used in marmalades), or starfruit while they are taking Venclexta. These products may increase the amount of Venclexta in the patient’s blood. 
Venclexta can cause serious side effects, including: Low White Blood Cell Count (neutropenia): Low white blood cell counts are common with Venclexta, but can also be severe. A doctor will do blood tests to check a patient’s blood counts during treatment with Venclexta. Patients should tell their doctor right away if they have a fever or any signs of an infection. 
The most common side effects of Venclexta include low white blood cell count,diarrhea, nausea, low red blood cell count, upper respiratory tract infection, low platelet count, and feeling tired. 
Venclexta may cause fertility problems in males. This may affect the ability to father a child. Patients should talk to their doctor if they have concerns about fertility. 
These are not all the possible side effects of Venclexta. Patients should tell their doctor if they have any side effect that bothers them or that does not go away. 
Report side effects to the FDA at (800) FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/medwatch . Patients and caregivers may also report side effects to Genentech at (888) 835-2555.

46,The Navajo Nation Is Experiencing a Water Crisis,,2017-04-13,"The Navajo Nation Is Experiencing a Water Crisis 
In Indian Country, 26,000 homes lack access to safe water and/or sanitation services. Yessenia Funes Apr 13, 2017 2:37PM EDT Sandstone formations near Round Rock December 5, 2002, on the Navajo Indian Reservation, Arizona. Photo: David McNew/Getty Images 

Since the water crisis in Flint, Michigan began in 2014, more similar crises have made headlines: East Chicago, Indiana ; East Porterville, California and, now, Arizona’s Navajo Nation. 
NPR went to the southwestern Native community to explore what its water situation is like in a report published yesterday (April 12). One-third of the Navajo Nation doesn’t have running water. 
The story zooms in on the reservation’s Saint Michael’s Association for Special Education, a school for children with disabilities. Here, the water may spew yellow, brown or even black. 
“It has a certain stench to it. Sometimes you'll smell ... kinda like a egg smell,"" says Felencia Woodie, whose eight-year-old son attends the school. 
The school serves students who require medical equipment which needs to be cleaned daily. The staff must use five-gallon water jugs to clean it as using the discolored tap water makes them uneasy—even though the water technically meets national primary drinking water standards. 
NPR goes on to explain more clearly: 
While it's not poisonous, there is still the matter of appearance. 
""People typically won't drink water if it tastes bad or if it looks bad or if it stinks,"" says Adam Bringhurst, who studies water resources at Northern Arizona University. 
He says the Environmental Protection Agency has established two levels of standards. The primary standard — filtering contaminants that harm your health — is required by law. The secondary standard — eliminating taste, color and smell — is voluntary. 
The school spent almost $3,000 last year on bottled water, reports NPR. The costs that put a strain on the school. Digdeep, a water-focused nonprofit, is now raising $100,000 to build a water filtration system for Saint Michael’s with the hopes that the project will be finished this summer. 
This issue isn't something just the Navajo are experiencing: According to Indian Health Services, 26,000 American Indian and Alaska Native homes lack access a safe water supply and/or waste disposal facilities.",['Porterville'],colorlines.com
47,"The Director of ‘Water & Power: A California Heist’ on Water, Big Business, and the Government",Elettra Wiedemann,2017-04-25,"Twitter Photo: Courtesy National Geographic/Ted Gesing Water Week is a Teen Vogue series exploring the ways that water intersects with issues we care about, like climate change, reproductive rights, racial equality, social justice, and personal health. Teen Vogue is hosting a one-day online screening of the new documentary Water & Power: A California Heist . The film has all the elements of classic noir — robber barons making nefarious deals in secret meetings with corrupt politicians, dark agendas looming in the California sunshine — but what’s happening is all too real. Water & Power details how agribusiness billionaires are set up to rake in profits while many citizens lack access to clean drinking water, and how the state’s environmental ideals have been compromised at the expense of its citizens, who are now facing not only the increasing effects of climate change but a rise in water contamination rivaling that of Flint, Michigan. Click below to watch the movie, and ahead, read an interview with its director, Marina Zenovich, about the project, the events leading up to the current California water crisis, and how she thinks young people can get involved and help. Teen Vogue : Before you made Water & Power did you take fresh water for granted? Marina Zenovich: Well, now every time I turn the tap on, I think I should shut it off. Water is something we’ve always thought would be here forever. Making this film made me realize that it's not. It’s been a very sobering realization that we don't manufacture water. TV : The subtitle of the film is A California Heist , which implies that something was stolen. Who are the bad guys here? MZ: The problem is, we're now in an environment where there are a lot of bad people. They've banded together with one mission and it’s not saving the planet, or protecting water. It is greed. The bad guy to me is greed. To me, that’s the core of the film. Like, how much is enough? It never stops. It's just getting worse and worse. These people don't seem to have regard for the planet or water. They're just living in their nice, lovely, air-conditioned, gilded cages. They don’t have any interaction with the people who this is affecting. TV : A lot of the problems with water inequity seem to stem back to what’s called “The Monterey Agreements,” contracts that were signed in 1994. They gave big agricultural conglomerates preferential treatment when it comes to water. How did that happen? MZ: The meetings took place behind closed doors. The State Water Project [which the Monterey Agreement amended] was voted on by the taxpayers, and yet the contract was changed behind closed doors, so the people who voted it in weren't privy to the changes. TV : How was that even possible? MZ: Well, the water agencies that were involved, like the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and Kern County Water Agency, felt that it was their contracts, and they could renegotiate them if they wanted to. But they were only thinking of themselves. They were not thinking that this is part of the state of California. So the city and Ag were negotiating. The people were excluded, the lawyers were excluded — it was like a huge red flag. The people of California should have been represented. TV : What is your advice to our readers if, after watching your documentary, they want to get involved? Whether they're in the county, or in state, or even out of state, what do you feel would be the most effective way to get involved and help? MZ: I think young people should become investigative journalists, and become lawyers for the right reasons. We can’t have a system that's just run by greed. We all have to keep fighting to try to get the power back [from corporate lobbyists and corporations]. Seek out other people like you, who believe in the things that you believe in, and try to work together. TV: What’s been the general emotional response to the film? Do you think it has inspired people to become active?

48,Trump EPA Rejects Ban on Pesticide Linked to Learning Disabilities in Children,"Miriam Rotkin-Ellman, Veena Singla, NRDC",2017-04-02,"Environment Trump EPA Rejects Ban on Pesticide Linked to Learning Disabilities in Children Now, California's kids and communities are at risk of exposure to the toxic pesticide chlorpyrifos in food, water and the air.

The Trump administration has rejected a proposed ban on the toxic pesticide chlorpyrifos, leaving California kids and communities at risk of exposure to this chemical in food, water and the air. US EPA’s chlorpyrifos evaluation last fall found that the pesticide is unsafe to use in any amount, because use leads to toxic residues on fruits and vegetables , drinking water contamination, and harmful drift from fields in agricultural communities. The chemical is found on numerous common fruits and vegetables at levels up to 14,000 times greater than those previously thought to be safe for kids to eat. 
US EPA had proposed to ban all food uses of chlorpyrifos in 2015, but Wednesday’s action from Scott Pruitt’s EPA is a complete about-face. Because federal action will be stymied , California must take up where EPA left off, implement the ban and protect our state’s children from Trump Administration backtracking. 
In the face of an administration that is all too willing to ignore science and dismantle common-sense public health and safety protections , California needs to follow the lead of US EPA in recognizing the significant science that shows low-level exposures to chlorpyrifos before birth can be linked to the following types of neurodevelopmental problems: Delays in mental development, lower IQ and working memory deficits ( Rauh 2006 , Rauh 2011 ) ADHD and other attention disorders 
What’s at stake in California 
There’s about a half million expectant moms and 2.5 million children under age 4 in California that could be at risk from toxic residues of chlorpyrifos on food, including favorite fruits like apples. 
A million pounds of chlorpyrifos are used every year in CA, with Kern, Fresno, Tulare and Imperial Counties topping the list at more than 100,000 pounds of the chemical used in each. Latino schoolchildren disproportionately attend a school with chlorpyrifos used nearby, with over 300 schools and 150,000 children in harm’s way. 
Farmworkers, their families and agricultural communities face the biggest risks from chlorpyrifos drifting from fields into homes and schools. According to US EPA’s analysis, pregnant women in CA communities could be putting their babies at risk just by breathing—as shown in the graph below, the average levels of chlorpyrifos found in the air in Salinas, Ripon and Shafter exceed EPA’s target risk level. 
Graph shows the EPA target risk level for chlorpyrifos in air, for chronic exposure to adults, compared to the average air levels measured in Salinas, Ripon, and Shafter by the CA Department of Pesticide Regulation. (Source: US EPA 2016 Chlorpyrifos Revised Human Health Risk Assessment for Registration Review, Table 9.1) 
Within these dispassionate numbers are the stories of California children who bear the brunt of continued chlorpyrifos use in the state— children like Eva Galindo and Alan Munoz who suffer from autism and ADHD. 
California must honor Cesar Chavez and protect our agricultural communities 
The statewide coalition Californians for Pesticide Reform, representing more than 190 groups, is asking Gov. Jerry Brown to step in and implement US EPA’s proposed chlorpyrifos ban in California. Both Governor Brown and California lawmakers have vowed to stand up to the Trump administration’s disregard of science and defend the state’s people. 
California needs to: Update, then finalize, the state’s chlorpyrifos safety assessment to reflect the most current science from US EPA’s assessment on negative impacts to children’s brains. Protect our food, water, kids and farmworkers by ending the use of chlorpyrifos. 
Failing to act on chlorpyrifos comes at the expense of our children’s health. That’s a price the Trump Administration may be willing to pay to promote their agenda of deregulation and polluter profits, but that we cannot afford as a nation. It’s time for California to follow the science, ban chlorpyrifos and lead the way to a healthier future.

49,8 Million Californians Have Been Drinking Polluted Water For Years | The Huffington Post,Joseph Erbentraut,2017-04-15,"04/14/2017 03:23 pm ET 8 Million Californians Have Been Drinking Polluted Water For Years If you want to know how difficult it is to get a water contaminant regulated in the U.S., take a look at the Golden State. By Joseph Erbentraut Credit: Robert Galbraith/Reuters An irrigation pipe is seen at a farm near Cantua Creek, California. Communities in the San Joaquin Valley have been battling a dangerous pesticide byproduct in their drinking water. California is expected to set a strict state-level maximum contaminant level for a probable human carcinogen called 1,2,3-trichloropropane (TCP) next week ― 28 years after the state’s Water Resources Control Board first detected the chemical in its drinking water system. If the board passes this provision, utilities would be required to test for TCP and treat it out of the water if levels exceed 5 parts per trillion. TCP was initially used as an industrial solvent , paint remover and degreasing agent, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. It’s also a byproduct of two pesticides that were widely used in agriculture in the 1980s. Both of those pesticides, Dow’s Telone and Shell’s D-D, have long since been discontinued or reformulated to remove the TCP, but environmental advocacy groups like the Environmental Working Group say the damage has already been done. TCP has been detected in the water supplies of 94 different water systems serving 8 million Californians, according to an EWG report released this week citing EPA monitoring results. “This is a contaminant that, because it does not adhere to soil, very readily contaminates and migrates into groundwater,” Bill Walker, managing editor at the EWG and co-author of the report, told The Huffington Post. “It’s remarkably persistent. Once it’s in the water, it stays there for centuries.” Sixty percent of these water systems are in the agriculture-heavy San Joaquin Valley. Tests for Kern County, which is in the region, show that 151 contaminated wells and 20 different water systems have exceeded the state’s proposed legal limit for TCP since at least 2001. Some communities have sought to address the TCP in their water by suing the companies involved. Last December, the city of Clovis in Fresno County won a $22 million judgement against Shell, and there are currently dozens of other legal actions against Shell and Dow. A new statewide limit for TCP will strengthen the case of utilities that lack the funding to properly treat contamination without raising rates for their customers, said Jenny Rempel, director of education and engagement at the Community Water Center advocacy group. Many people who live in affected areas are from low-income families. “This shows the state is prioritizing community health,” Rempel said. “This is a huge step forward toward making sure Californians have safe water.” Short-term exposure to TCP can irritate people’s eyes, noses and throats ; animal studies have linked long-term exposure to reduced body weight and liver and kidney damage, according to the EPA. Multiple animal studies have also linked TCP exposure to the development of cancerous tumors. The EPA has listed TCP as a contaminant candidate since 2009 and has required larger water utilities to test for it since 2013 , but so far the agency hasn’t set a federal maximum contaminant level for TCP. This means it’s up to states to regulate the chemical, which has been found — at a rate six times higher than the proposed California limit — in water systems that serve about 4 million people in 13 other states. But many states lack the resources, scientific expertise or political will to address the issue, Walker said. So far, only Hawaii has passed regulations addressing TCP. “California can go their own way,” Walker said. “But for other states it’s a horrible situation that we know this contamination is out there and states are waiting for the EPA to act, but the EPA has not acted.” It seems unlikely that the situation will improve under President Donald Trump. TCP is just one of dozens of chemicals that the EPA has labeled a water contaminant candidate but hasn’t regulated. Since 1999, the agency has named 109 contaminants for which water utilities must test. Pesticides were increasingly among the group of contaminant candidates the agency is considering for regulation, but it’s unclear whether that trend will continue under EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt ― especially since he was behind a move last month to reverse a proposed ban on an insecticide that has been linked to learning disabilities in children. Regardless of whether the EPA takes action, pesticides are increasingly turning up in tap water. This month, a group of scientists at the University of Iowa and the U.S. Geological Survey identified neonicotinoids — a class of pesticides that include the popular insecticide imidacloprid — in treated drinking water for the first time. Although it’s not known how exposure to neonicotinoids can harm humans, clean water advocates say the Iowa study is another indicator of the unregulated, understudied dangers that are likely present in many Americans’ water supplies. “Contrary to what many people think, in the U.S. in 2017, you are not guaranteed to get a safe glass of water when you turn on the tap in your kitchen,” Walker said.

PORTAGE, Ind. (AP) - A spill at a U.S. Steel plant in northern Indiana that sent wastewater containing a potentially carcinogenic chemical into a Lake Michigan tributary was apparently caused by a pipe failure but testing has found none of that toxic substance in the lake, the company and federal officials said Wednesday. 
Tuesday's spill of an unknown amount of wastewater led to the closure of three beach areas at the scenic Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and prompted a local water utility to stop drawing water from the lake out of ""an abundance of caution,"" the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said. 
U.S. Steel said a preliminary investigation shows an expansion joint failed Tuesday in a pipe at its Portage, Indiana, facility, allowing wastewater from an electroplating treatment process that contains hexavalent chromium to flow into the wrong wastewater treatment plant at the complex. 
That wastewater eventually flowed into the Burns Waterway, a lake tributary, at a point about 100 yards from Lake Michigan, said the EPA, which is overseeing the response to the spill. 
Indiana American Water, which operates a water treatment plant at nearby Ogden Dunes that draws water from the lake about two miles from Burns Waterway, temporarily shuttered that plant following the spill, and is instead tapping water reserves. 
Andy Maguire, the EPA's on-scene coordinator, said initial water testing results at the utility's intake point showed hexavalent chromium levels slightly above the detection limit for that chemical. But he said a subsequent test of the same sample showed levels at or below the detection limit, which Maguire called well below EPA's health-based standard for ingestion of that chemical. 
""Even if that number was slightly above the detection limit, it's below our very conservative health-based levels for ingestion. That's not a drinking water standard. Those numbers are calculated by an ingestion model,"" he said, to account for events such as a person accidentally drinking surface water while swimming. 
Maguire said testing is continuing at the intake and other points on the lake and adjacent areas, but hexavalent chromium from the spill has so far not been found in the lake. 
The EPA has said that hexavalent chromium - a toxic byproduct of industrial processes - might be carcinogenic if ingested. The toxic heavy metal is used in a variety of industrial processes, including steelmaking and corrosion prevention, and as a pigment in dyes, paints and inks. It's also found in ash from coal-fired power plants. 
A case involving the chemical was made famous by the 2000 film ""Erin Brockovich,"" which was based on a utility's disposal of water laced with hexavalent chromium in unlined ponds near Hinkley, California. That disposal method polluted drinking water wells and resulted in a $333 million settlement. 
Hexavalent chromium has been linked to a variety of illnesses when inhaled, including lung cancer. Laboratory rats have developed cancer after drinking water tainted with the chemical, according to the National Institutes of Health. 
U.S. Steel said the spilled wastewater came from a process used to treat steel after it has been electroplated. That wastewater is supposed to flow into a special treatment plant, but the pipe failure prevented that from happening. 
Maguire said EPA and U.S. Steel are still working to determine how much wastewater was discharged. 
U.S. Steel has halted all production processes at its Portage facility as it works with the EPA, state and local officials to respond to the spill, repair the damaged pipe and remove the hexavalent chromium. 
The National Park Service said it closed three beaches along the nearby Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. based on a recommendation that all beaches within three miles of the spill site be closed as a precaution to protect park visitors.  ",['Poplar'],kfvs12.com

By MICHAEL BIESECKERAssociated Press 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Dow Chemical is pushing the Trump administration to scrap the findings of federal scientists who point to a family of widely used pesticides as harmful to about 1,800 critically threatened or endangered species. 
Lawyers representing Dow, whose CEO also heads a White House manufacturing working group, and two other makers of organophosphates sent letters last week to the heads of three Cabinet agencies. The companies asked them ""to set aside"" the results of government studies the companies contend are fundamentally flawed. 
The letters, dated April 13, were obtained by The Associated Press. 
Dow Chemical chairman and CEO Andrew Liveris is a close adviser to President Donald Trump. The company wrote a $1 million check to help underwrite Trump's inaugural festivities. 
Over the last four years, government scientists have compiled an official record running more than 10,000 pages showing the three pesticides under review - chlorpyrifos, diazinon and malathion - pose a risk to nearly every endangered species they studied. Regulators at the three federal agencies, which share responsibilities for enforcing the Endangered Species Act, are close to issuing findings expected to result in new limits on how and where the highly toxic pesticides can be used. 
The industry's request comes after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced last month he was reversing an Obama-era effort to bar the use of Dow's chlorpyrifos pesticide on food after recent peer-reviewed studies found that even tiny levels of exposure could hinder the development of children's brains. In his prior job as Oklahoma's attorney general, Pruitt often aligned himself in legal disputes with the interests of executives and corporations who supported his state campaigns. He filed more than one dozen lawsuits seeking to overturn some of the same regulations he is now charged with enforcing. 
Pruitt declined to answer questions from reporters Wednesday as he toured a polluted Superfund site in Indiana. A spokesman for the agency later told AP that Pruitt won't ""prejudge"" any potential rule-making decisions as ""we are trying to restore regulatory sanity to EPA's work."" 
""We have had no meetings with Dow on this topic and we are reviewing petitions as they come in, giving careful consideration to sound science and good policymaking,"" said J.P. Freire, EPA's associate administrator for public affairs. ""The administrator is committed to listening to stakeholders affected by EPA's regulations, while also reviewing past decisions."" 
The office of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Natural Marine Fisheries Service, did not respond to emailed questions. A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service, referred questions back to EPA. 
As with the recent human studies of chlorpyrifos, Dow hired its own scientists to produce a lengthy rebuttal to the government studies showing the risks posed to endangered species by organophosphates. 
The EPA's recent biological evaluation of chlorpyrifos found the pesticide is ""likely to adversely affect"" 1,778 of the 1,835 animals and plants accessed as part of its study, including critically endangered or threatened species of frogs, fish, birds and mammals. Similar results were shown for malathion and diazinon. 
In a statement, the Dow subsidiary that sells chlorpyrifos said its lawyers asked for the EPA's biological assessment to be withdrawn because its ""scientific basis was not reliable."" 
""Dow AgroSciences is committed to the production and marketing of products that will help American farmers feed the world, and do so with full respect for human health and the environment, including endangered and threatened species,"" the statement said. ""These letters, and the detailed scientific analyses that support them, demonstrate that commitment."" 
FMC Corp., which sells malathion, said the withdrawal of the EPA studies will allow the necessary time for the ""best available"" scientific data to be compiled. 
""Malathion is a critical tool in protecting agriculture from damaging pests,"" the company said. 
Diazinon maker Makhteshim Agan of North America Inc., which does business under the name Adama, did not respond to emails seeking comment. 
Environmental advocates were not surprised the companies might seek to forestall new regulations that might hurt their profits, but said Wednesday that criticism of the government's scientists was unfounded. The methods used to conduct EPA's biological evaluations were developed by the National Academy of Sciences. 
Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said Dow's experts were trying to hold EPA scientists to an unrealistic standard of data collection that could only be achieved under ""perfect laboratory conditions."" 
""You can't just take an endangered fish out of the wild, take it to the lab and then expose it to enough pesticides until it dies to get that sort of data,"" Hartl said. ""It's wrong morally, and it's illegal."" 
Originally derived from a nerve gas developed by Nazi Germany, chlorpyrifos has been sprayed on citrus fruits, apples, cherries and other crops for decades. It is among the most widely used agricultural pesticides in the United States, with Dow selling about 5 million pounds domestically each year. 
As a result, traces of the chemical are commonly found in sources of drinking water. A 2012 study at the University of California at Berkeley found that 87 percent of umbilical-cord blood samples tested from newborn babies contained detectable levels of chlorpyrifos. 
In 2005, the Bush administration ordered an end to residential use of diazinon to kill yard pests such as ants and grub worms after determining that it poses a human health risk, particularly to children. However it is still approved for use by farmers, who spray it on fruits and vegetables. 
Malathion is widely sprayed to control mosquitoes and fruit flies. It is also an active ingredient in some shampoos prescribed to children for treating lice. 
A coalition of environmental groups has fought in court for years to spur EPA to more closely examine the risk posed to humans and endangered species by pesticides, especially organophosphates. 
""Endangered species are the canary in the coal mine,"" Hartl said. Since many of the threatened species are aquatic, he said they are often the first to show the effects of long-term chemical contamination in rivers and lakes used as sources of drinking water by humans. 
Dow, which spent more than $13.6 million on lobbying in 2016, has long wielded substantial political power in the nation's capital. There is no indication the chemical giant's influence has waned. 
When Trump signed an executive order in February mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations, Dow's chief executive was at Trump's side. 
""Andrew, I would like to thank you for initially getting the group together and for the fantastic job you've done,"" Trump said as he signed the order during an Oval Office ceremony. The president then handed his pen to Liveris to keep as a souvenir. 
Rachelle Schikorra, the director of public affairs for Dow Chemical, said any suggestion that the company's $1 million donation to Trump's inaugural committee was intended to help influence regulatory decisions made by the new administration is ""completely off the mark."" 
""Dow actively participates in policymaking and political processes, including political contributions to candidates, parties and causes, in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws,"" Schikorra said. ""Dow maintains and is committed to the highest standard of ethical conduct in all such activity.""

WASHINGTON (AP) - Dow Chemical is pushing a Trump administration open to scrapping regulations to ignore the findings of federal scientists who point to a family of widely used pesticides as harmful to about 1,800 critically threatened or endangered species. 
Lawyers representing Dow, whose CEO is a close adviser to Trump, and two other manufacturers of organophosphates sent letters last week to the heads of three of Trump's Cabinet agencies. The companies asked them ""to set aside"" the results of government studies the companies contend are fundamentally flawed. 
Dow Chemical wrote a $1 million check to help underwrite Trump's inaugural festivities, and its chairman and CEO, Andrew Liveris, heads a White House manufacturing working group. 
The industry's request comes after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced last month he was reversing an Obama-era effort to bar the use of Dow's chlorpyrifos pesticide on food after recent peer-reviewed studies found that even tiny levels of exposure could hinder the development of children's brains. In his prior job as Oklahoma's attorney general, Pruitt often aligned himself in legal disputes with the interests of executives and corporations who supported his state campaigns. He filed more than a dozen lawsuits seeking to overturn some of the same regulations he is now charged with enforcing. 
Pruitt declined to answer questions from reporters Wednesday as he toured a polluted Superfund site in Indiana. A spokesman for the agency later told AP that Pruitt won't ""prejudge"" any potential rule-making decisions as ""we are trying to restore regulatory sanity to EPA's work."" 
The letters to Cabinet heads, dated April 13, were obtained by The Associated Press. As with the recent human studies of chlorpyrifos, Dow hired its own scientists to produce a lengthy rebuttal to the government studies. 
Over the past four years, government scientists have compiled an official record running more than 10,000 pages indicating the three pesticides under review - chlorpyrifos, diazinon and malathion - pose a risk to nearly every endangered species they studied. Regulators at the three federal agencies, which share responsibilities for enforcing the Endangered Species Act, are close to issuing findings expected to result in new limits on how and where the highly toxic pesticides can be used. 
""We have had no meetings with Dow on this topic and we are reviewing petitions as they come in, giving careful consideration to sound science and good policymaking,"" said J.P. Freire, EPA's associate administrator for public affairs. ""The administrator is committed to listening to stakeholders affected by EPA's regulations, while also reviewing past decisions."" 
The office of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Natural Marine Fisheries Service, did not respond to emailed questions. A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service, referred questions back to EPA. 
The EPA's recent biological evaluation of chlorpyrifos found the pesticide is ""likely to adversely affect"" 1,778 of the 1,835 animals and plants accessed as part of its study, including critically endangered or threatened species of frogs, fish, birds and mammals. Similar results were shown for malathion and diazinon. 
In a statement, the Dow subsidiary that sells chlorpyrifos said its lawyers asked for the EPA's biological assessment to be withdrawn because its ""scientific basis was not reliable."" 
""Dow AgroSciences is committed to the production and marketing of products that will help American farmers feed the world, and do so with full respect for human health and the environment, including endangered and threatened species,"" the statement said. ""These letters, and the detailed scientific analyses that support them, demonstrate that commitment."" 
FMC Corp., which sells malathion, said the withdrawal of the EPA studies would allow the necessary time for the ""best available"" scientific data to be compiled. 
""Malathion is a critical tool in protecting agriculture from damaging pests,"" the company said. 
Diazinon maker Makhteshim Agan of North America Inc., which does business under the name Adama, did not respond to emails seeking comment. 
Environmental advocates said Wednesday that criticism of the government's scientists was unfounded. The methods used to conduct EPA's biological evaluations were developed by the National Academy of Sciences. 
Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said Dow's experts were trying to hold EPA scientists to an unrealistic standard of data collection that could only be achieved under ""perfect laboratory conditions."" 
""You can't just take an endangered fish out of the wild, take it to the lab and then expose it to enough pesticides until it dies to get that sort of data,"" Hartl said. ""It's wrong morally, and it's illegal."" 
Organophosphorus gas was originally developed as a chemical weapon by Nazi Germany. Dow has been selling Chlorpyrifos for spraying on citrus fruits, apples, cherries and other crops since the 1960s. It is among the most widely used agricultural pesticides in the United States, with Dow selling about 5 million pounds domestically each year. 
As a result, traces of the chemical are commonly found in sources of drinking water. A 2012 study at the University of California at Berkeley found that 87 percent of umbilical-cord blood samples tested from newborn babies contained detectable levels of chlorpyrifos. 
In 2005, the Bush administration ordered an end to residential use of diazinon to kill yard pests such as ants and grub worms after determining that it poses a human health risk, particularly to children. However it is still approved for use by farmers, who spray it on fruits and vegetables. 
Malathion is widely sprayed to control mosquitoes and fruit flies. It is also an active ingredient in some shampoos prescribed to children for treating lice. 
A coalition of environmental groups has fought in court for years to spur EPA to more closely examine the risk posed to humans and endangered species by pesticides, especially organophosphates. 
""Endangered species are the canary in the coal mine,"" Hartl said. Since many of the threatened species are aquatic, he said they are often the first to show the effects of long-term chemical contamination in rivers and lakes used as sources of drinking water by humans. 
Dow, which spent more than $13.6 million on lobbying in 2016, has long wielded substantial political power in the nation's capital. There is no indication the chemical giant's influence has waned. 
When Trump signed an executive order in February mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations, Dow's chief executive was at Trump's side. 
""Andrew, I would like to thank you for initially getting the group together and for the fantastic job you've done,"" Trump said as he signed the order during an Oval Office ceremony. The president then handed his pen to Liveris to keep as a souvenir. 
Rachelle Schikorra, the director of public affairs for Dow Chemical, said any suggestion that the company's $1 million donation to Trump's inaugural committee was intended to help influence regulatory decisions is ""completely off the mark."" 
""Dow actively participates in policymaking and political processes, including political contributions to candidates, parties and causes, in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws,"" Schikorra said. ""Dow maintains and is committed to the highest standard of ethical conduct in all such activity.""

HANFORD, Calif. (AP) - Knee-high tufts of grass dot the streets of Hardwick, a rural neighborhood with a few dozen homes hemmed in by vineyards and walnut and almond orchards in California's agriculture-rich San Joaquin Valley. 
Nearby, the Kings River - swollen with rainwater and Sierra Nevada snowmelt - meanders through fields. Water is abundant in the river but it may not last. 
Despite winter storms that have turned much of California's parched landscape to vibrant green, the drought has yet to loosen its grip on thousands of residents in the valley. Many people must still use water stored in large tanks in their yard to wash dishes and bathe. 
Scientists at Stanford University and NASA say excessive pumping of wells during the drought has tapped out some underground sources of water that will never recover. 
At the height of the drought, nearly 2,400 wells dried up, affecting 12,000 people, state officials said. 
The drought emergency remains in effect in Kings, Fresno, Tulare and Tuolumne counties, even after one of California's wettest winters in years prompted officials to declare an end to the historic, five-year dry spell in nearly all of the nation's most populous state. 
David Miguel relies on water from a large, black emergency tank located just steps from the front door of his mobile home. A water delivery truck tops it off every few weeks. 
""You can take a bath with it, do dishes - no problem,"" said Miguel, a 64-year-old retired farm hand who was raised on his family's long-gone dairy operation in Hardwick. ""I wouldn't drink it."" 
Miguel and his neighbor survive on the trucked-in water and deliveries of bottled drinking water. They live in the last two Hardwick homes awaiting a state grant to hook into a reliable water main. 
Miguel doesn't know when his home will get connected to the new 470-foot (143-meter) community well outside the county fire station, but he anticipates a $50 monthly water bill - more than it costs to run his own well. 
Miguel laughed when asked what he thinks about Gov. Jerry Brown's recent declaration that the drought is over for most of California. 
""Oh, is that so?"" he joked. 
Keeping the emergency declaration in place in a few areas allows officials to prolong efforts to find permanent water supplies for desperate residents. 
In parts of the San Joaquin Valley, underground aquifers - layers of earth saturated by water - collapsed from over-pumping during years of dry weather, according to scientists at Stanford and NASA who studied satellite imagery to measure sinking land. 
They say layers of clay soil have compacted, permanently reducing natural aquifer storage capacity. 
Throughout the San Joaquin Valley, the situation has left roughly 900 homes relying on storage tanks for residential water. 
Emergency water tanks for residents have cost the state nearly $28 million since 2014, with more than half in Tulare County. 
Calls for help have slowed significantly, said Susan Atkins of Self-Help Enterprises, a nonprofit organization that helps residents get tanks and navigate government bureaucracy. 
""But they're still coming in,"" she said about the calls. 
In Hardwick, which has no sidewalks or streetlights, residents say their wells began drying up after farmers on three sides of the community dug deep wells to irrigate their orchards during the drought, when water from rivers and canals was scarce. 
Resident Alvin Lea said his 120-foot (37-meter) well that was drilled in the 1960s dried up, costing him $17,000 for a new one that was more than 100 feet (30.48 meters) deeper. 
Lea, 77, a retired mechanic, keeps his swimming pool full for his great grandchildren to play in during scorching summer days. He raises 200 exotic birds, which also need to drink, he said, tipping back the brim of his hat to peer at them through a wire mesh enclosure. 
Randy Herman, a long-distance trucker with a family, says it's obvious to him that his community is a long way from rebounding from drought. 
After his well ran dry, he connected to a large water tank before finally hooking up to the community well. Not all of his neighbors are so fortunate, he said. 
""You got tanks, you got water bottles,"" Herman said. ""I don't think the drought's over. It's going to take a long time.""  ",['Tulare'],nbc29.com

The EPA's recent biological evaluation of chlorpyrifos found the pesticide is ""likely to adversely affect"" 1,778 of the 1,835 animals and plants accessed as part of its study, including critically endangered or threatened species of frogs, fish, birds and mammals. Similar results were shown for malathion and diazinon. 
In a statement, the Dow subsidiary that sells chlorpyrifos said its lawyers asked for the EPA's biological assessment to be withdrawn because its ""scientific basis was not reliable."" 
""Dow AgroSciences is committed to the production and marketing of products that will help American farmers feed the world, and do so with full respect for human health and the environment, including endangered and threatened species,"" the statement said. ""These letters, and the detailed scientific analyses that support them, demonstrate that commitment."" 
FMC Corp., which sells malathion, said the withdrawal of the EPA studies would allow the necessary time for the ""best available"" scientific data to be compiled. 
""Malathion is a critical tool in protecting agriculture from damaging pests,"" the company said. 
Diazinon maker Makhteshim Agan of North America Inc., which does business under the name Adama, did not respond to emails seeking comment. 
Environmental advocates said Wednesday that criticism of the government's scientists was unfounded. The methods used to conduct EPA's biological evaluations were developed by the National Academy of Sciences. 
Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said Dow's experts were trying to hold EPA scientists to an unrealistic standard of data collection that could only be achieved under ""perfect laboratory conditions."" 
""You can't just take an endangered fish out of the wild, take it to the lab and then expose it to enough pesticides until it dies to get that sort of data,"" Hartl said. ""It's wrong morally, and it's illegal."" 
Organophosphorus gas was originally developed as a chemical weapon by Nazi Germany. Dow has been selling Chlorpyrifos for spraying on citrus fruits, apples, cherries and other crops since the 1960s. It is among the most widely used agricultural pesticides in the United States, with Dow selling about 5 million pounds domestically each year. 
As a result, traces of the chemical are commonly found in sources of drinking water. A 2012 study at the University of California at Berkeley found that 87 percent of umbilical-cord blood samples tested from newborn babies contained detectable levels of chlorpyrifos. 
In 2005, the Bush administration ordered an end to residential use of diazinon to kill yard pests such as ants and grub worms after determining that it poses a human health risk, particularly to children. However it is still approved for use by farmers, who spray it on fruits and vegetables. 
Malathion is widely sprayed to control mosquitoes and fruit flies. It is also an active ingredient in some shampoos prescribed to children for treating lice. 
A coalition of environmental groups has fought in court for years to spur EPA to more closely examine the risk posed to humans and endangered species by pesticides, especially organophosphates. 
""Endangered species are the canary in the coal mine,"" Hartl said. Since many of the threatened species are aquatic, he said they are often the first to show the effects of long-term chemical contamination in rivers and lakes used as sources of drinking water by humans. 
Dow, which spent more than $13.6 million on lobbying in 2016, has long wielded substantial political power in the nation's capital. There is no indication the chemical giant's influence has waned. 
When Trump signed an executive order in February mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations, Dow's chief executive was at Trump's side. 
""Andrew, I would like to thank you for initially getting the group together and for the fantastic job you've done,"" Trump said as he signed the order during an Oval Office ceremony. The president then handed his pen to Liveris to keep as a souvenir. 
Rachelle Schikorra, the director of public affairs for Dow Chemical, said any suggestion that the company's $1 million donation to Trump's inaugural committee was intended to help influence regulatory decisions is ""completely off the mark."" 
""Dow actively participates in policymaking and political processes, including political contributions to candidates, parties and causes, in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws,"" Schikorra said.

""You can't just take an endangered fish out of the wild, take it to the lab and then expose it to enough pesticides until it dies to get that sort of data,"" Hartl said. ""It's wrong morally, and it's illegal."" 
Organophosphorus gas was originally developed as a chemical weapon by Nazi Germany. Dow has been selling Chlorpyrifos for spraying on citrus fruits, apples, cherries and other crops since the 1960s. It is among the most widely used agricultural pesticides in the United States, with Dow selling about 5 million pounds domestically each year. 
As a result, traces of the chemical are commonly found in sources of drinking water. A 2012 study at the University of California at Berkeley found that 87 percent of umbilical-cord blood samples tested from newborn babies contained detectable levels of chlorpyrifos. 
In 2005, the Bush administration ordered an end to residential use of diazinon to kill yard pests such as ants and grub worms after determining that it poses a human health risk, particularly to children. However it is still approved for use by farmers, who spray it on fruits and vegetables. 
Malathion is widely sprayed to control mosquitoes and fruit flies. It is also an active ingredient in some shampoos prescribed to children for treating lice. 
A coalition of environmental groups has fought in court for years to spur EPA to more closely examine the risk posed to humans and endangered species by pesticides, especially organophosphates. 
""Endangered species are the canary in the coal mine,"" Hartl said. Since many of the threatened species are aquatic, he said they are often the first to show the effects of long-term chemical contamination in rivers and lakes used as sources of drinking water by humans. 
Dow, which spent more than $13.6 million on lobbying in 2016, has long wielded substantial political power in the nation's capital. There is no indication the chemical giant's influence has waned. 
When Trump signed an executive order in February mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations, Dow's chief executive was at Trump's side. 
""Andrew, I would like to thank you for initially getting the group together and for the fantastic job you've done,"" Trump said as he signed the order during an Oval Office ceremony. The president then handed his pen to Liveris to keep as a souvenir. 
Rachelle Schikorra, the director of public affairs for Dow Chemical, said any suggestion that the company's $1 million donation to Trump's inaugural committee was intended to help influence regulatory decisions is ""completely off the mark."" 
""Dow actively participates in policymaking and political processes, including political contributions to candidates, parties and causes, in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws,"" Schikorra said. ""Dow maintains and is committed to the highest standard of ethical conduct in all such activity."" ___

Dow Chemical is pushing a Trump administration open to scrapping regulations to ignore the findings of federal scientists who point to a family of widely used pesticides as harmful to about 1,800 critically threatened or endangered species. 
Lawyers representing Dow, whose CEO is a close adviser to Trump, and two other manufacturers of organophosphates sent letters last week to the heads of three of Trump's Cabinet agencies. The companies asked them ""to set aside"" the results of government studies the companies contend are fundamentally flawed. 
Dow Chemical wrote a $1 million check to help underwrite Trump's inaugural festivities, and its chairman and CEO, Andrew Liveris, heads a White House manufacturing working group. 
The industry's request comes after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced last month he was reversing an Obama-era effort to bar the use of Dow's chlorpyrifos pesticide on food after recent peer-reviewed studies found that even tiny levels of exposure could hinder the development of children's brains. In his prior job as Oklahoma's attorney general, Pruitt often aligned himself in legal disputes with the interests of executives and corporations who supported his state campaigns. He filed more than a dozen lawsuits seeking to overturn some of the same regulations he is now charged with enforcing. 
Pruitt declined to answer questions from reporters Wednesday as he toured a polluted Superfund site in Indiana. A spokesman for the agency later told AP that Pruitt won't ""prejudge"" any potential rule-making decisions as ""we are trying to restore regulatory sanity to EPA's work."" 
The letters to Cabinet heads, dated April 13, were obtained by The Associated Press. As with the recent human studies of chlorpyrifos, Dow hired its own scientists to produce a lengthy rebuttal to the government studies. 
Over the past four years, government scientists have compiled an official record running more than 10,000 pages indicating the three pesticides under review — chlorpyrifos, diazinon and malathion — pose a risk to nearly every endangered species they studied. Regulators at the three federal agencies, which share responsibilities for enforcing the Endangered Species Act, are close to issuing findings expected to result in new limits on how and where the highly toxic pesticides can be used. 
""We have had no meetings with Dow on this topic and we are reviewing petitions as they come in, giving careful consideration to sound science and good policymaking,"" said J.P. Freire, EPA's associate administrator for public affairs. ""The administrator is committed to listening to stakeholders affected by EPA's regulations, while also reviewing past decisions."" 
The office of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Natural Marine Fisheries Service, did not respond to emailed questions. A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service, referred questions back to EPA. 
The EPA's recent biological evaluation of chlorpyrifos found the pesticide is ""likely to adversely affect"" 1,778 of the 1,835 animals and plants accessed as part of its study, including critically endangered or threatened species of frogs, fish, birds and mammals. Similar results were shown for malathion and diazinon. 
In a statement, the Dow subsidiary that sells chlorpyrifos said its lawyers asked for the EPA's biological assessment to be withdrawn because its ""scientific basis was not reliable."" 
""Dow AgroSciences is committed to the production and marketing of products that will help American farmers feed the world, and do so with full respect for human health and the environment, including endangered and threatened species,"" the statement said. ""These letters, and the detailed scientific analyses that support them, demonstrate that commitment."" 
FMC Corp., which sells malathion, said the withdrawal of the EPA studies would allow the necessary time for the ""best available"" scientific data to be compiled. 
""Malathion is a critical tool in protecting agriculture from damaging pests,"" the company said. 
Diazinon maker Makhteshim Agan of North America Inc., which does business under the name Adama, did not respond to emails seeking comment.

1136 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE They built this town on the bottom of an old lakebed. No wonder it might flood.
Corcoran’s largest company is joining other local businesses, homeowners and even the 8000-inmate state prison system in making plans to flee the area if floodwater overspills the levees in coming weeks and inundates the community.
In a precautionary and expensive exercise, cotton king J.G. Boswell is doing more than planning - relocating some 10,000 cotton bales and thousands of barrels of tomato product they make here outside the potential flood zone to warehouses in Hanford, Visalia, and Fresno.
Joining Boswell are other major Corcoran companies that are taking predictions of a possible flood event seriously enough to spend money to relocate materials, equipment, and other assets.
Town hall attendees bring up immigrant, health care concerns
Homeowners in town have been seen filling storage pods in front of their residences, putting in valuables to be hauled off once advanced warning comes that the snowmelt can’t be held off, hopefully with enough notice to get out of town.
As to the prison and its inmates and staff, California Department of Corrections spokesman Bill Sessa says the state has contingency plans to relocate everyone if needed, but details won’t be made public beforehand.
Ironically, it was after the 1983 flood that this water-year is being compared to, that pushed this farm community to lobby for a prison to make help make-up the economic losses that came when the area was devastated by floodwaters.
As a result, the town got two prisons.
This is certainly not the first time the area has been threatened by floods having been built at the bottom of historic Tulare Lake.
But today there is a massive investment to worry about.
Boom goes business in Tulare County
“We have some $600 million in property assets to protect - not including the prisons, “ says reclamation district manager Dustin Fuller, Cross Creek Flood Control District,
Fuller is spearheading the drive to both shore up the levee as well as carrying the message to the community to be prepared to evacuate if given the word.
""If the water breaches that levee, everyone is compromised,” he told a crowd of worried residents a few days ago.
Historic Tulare Like stretched 690 square miles across the Central Valley, submerging towns like Corcoran and Stratford if had they been around back then, beneath 25 feet of Sierra runoff, with its shore lapping up on some beach in Lemoore.
Fuller points out the levee can hold back 1.1 million acre-feet of water, but not more and than that.
COS swim community stands behind dismissed coach
The major problem does not come from the Kern, Tule or Kaweah Rivers but high flows along the Kings River’s South Fork.
Besides local farms and industry, public institutions like the city are taking precautions, moving important records from their office to a SeaTrain cargo box installed at the WWT Plant near the railroad tracks on higher ground.
City Manager Kindon Meik says the city offered the school district to park their buses and outdoor equipment there too. He adds that most of the flood-prone area is west of the tracks and entities east of the tracks have less to worry about
Residents remember the flood of 1969 when levees were shored up with junk cars. They have posted pics on Facebook this month.

Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said Dow's experts were trying to hold EPA scientists to an unrealistic standard of data collection that could only be achieved under ""perfect laboratory conditions."" 
""You can't just take an endangered fish out of the wild, take it to the lab and then expose it to enough pesticides until it dies to get that sort of data,"" Hartl said. ""It's wrong morally, and it's illegal."" 
Organophosphorus gas was originally developed as a chemical weapon by Nazi Germany. Dow has been selling Chlorpyrifos for spraying on citrus fruits, apples, cherries and other crops since the 1960s. It is among the most widely used agricultural pesticides in the United States, with Dow selling about 5 million pounds domestically each year. 
As a result, traces of the chemical are commonly found in sources of drinking water. A 2012 study at the University of California at Berkeley found that 87 percent of umbilical-cord blood samples tested from newborn babies contained detectable levels of chlorpyrifos. 
In 2005, the Bush administration ordered an end to residential use of diazinon to kill yard pests such as ants and grub worms after determining that it poses a human health risk, particularly to children. However it is still approved for use by farmers, who spray it on fruits and vegetables. 
Malathion is widely sprayed to control mosquitoes and fruit flies. It is also an active ingredient in some shampoos prescribed to children for treating lice. 
A coalition of environmental groups has fought in court for years to spur EPA to more closely examine the risk posed to humans and endangered species by pesticides, especially organophosphates. 
""Endangered species are the canary in the coal mine,"" Hartl said. Since many of the threatened species are aquatic, he said they are often the first to show the effects of long-term chemical contamination in rivers and lakes used as sources of drinking water by humans. 
Dow, which spent more than $13.6 million on lobbying in 2016, has long wielded substantial political power in the nation's capital. There is no indication the chemical giant's influence has waned. 
When Trump signed an executive order in February mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations, Dow's chief executive was at Trump's side. 
""Andrew, I would like to thank you for initially getting the group together and for the fantastic job you've done,"" Trump said as he signed the order during an Oval Office ceremony. The president then handed his pen to Liveris to keep as a souvenir. 
Rachelle Schikorra, the director of public affairs for Dow Chemical, said any suggestion that the company's $1 million donation to Trump's inaugural committee was intended to help influence regulatory decisions is ""completely off the mark."" 
""Dow actively participates in policymaking and political processes, including political contributions to candidates, parties and causes, in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws,"" Schikorra said.

Dow Chemical is pushing a Trump administration open to scrapping regulations to ignore the findings of federal scientists who point to a family of widely used pesticides as harmful to about 1,800 critically threatened or endangered species. 
Lawyers representing Dow, whose CEO is a close adviser to Trump, and two other manufacturers of organophosphates sent letters last week to the heads of three of Trump's Cabinet agencies. The companies asked them ""to set aside"" the results of government studies the companies contend are fundamentally flawed. 
Dow Chemical wrote a $1 million check to help underwrite Trump's inaugural festivities, and its chairman and CEO, Andrew Liveris, heads a White House manufacturing working group. 
The industry's request comes after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced last month he was reversing an Obama-era effort to bar the use of Dow's chlorpyrifos pesticide on food after recent peer-reviewed studies found that even tiny levels of exposure could hinder the development of children's brains. In his prior job as Oklahoma's attorney general, Pruitt often aligned himself in legal disputes with the interests of executives and corporations who supported his state campaigns. He filed more than a dozen lawsuits seeking to overturn some of the same regulations he is now charged with enforcing. 
Pruitt declined to answer questions from reporters Wednesday as he toured a polluted Superfund site in Indiana. A spokesman for the agency later told AP that Pruitt won't ""prejudge"" any potential rule-making decisions as ""we are trying to restore regulatory sanity to EPA's work."" 
The letters to Cabinet heads, dated April 13, were obtained by The Associated Press. As with the recent human studies of chlorpyrifos, Dow hired its own scientists to produce a lengthy rebuttal to the government studies. 
Over the past four years, government scientists have compiled an official record running more than 10,000 pages indicating the three pesticides under review — chlorpyrifos, diazinon and malathion — pose a risk to nearly every endangered species they studied. Regulators at the three federal agencies, which share responsibilities for enforcing the Endangered Species Act, are close to issuing findings expected to result in new limits on how and where the highly toxic pesticides can be used. 
""We have had no meetings with Dow on this topic and we are reviewing petitions as they come in, giving careful consideration to sound science and good policymaking,"" said J.P. Freire, EPA's associate administrator for public affairs. ""The administrator is committed to listening to stakeholders affected by EPA's regulations, while also reviewing past decisions."" 
The office of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Natural Marine Fisheries Service, did not respond to emailed questions. A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service, referred questions back to EPA. 
The EPA's recent biological evaluation of chlorpyrifos found the pesticide is ""likely to adversely affect"" 1,778 of the 1,835 animals and plants accessed as part of its study, including critically endangered or threatened species of frogs, fish, birds and mammals. Similar results were shown for malathion and diazinon. 
In a statement, the Dow subsidiary that sells chlorpyrifos said its lawyers asked for the EPA's biological assessment to be withdrawn because its ""scientific basis was not reliable."" 
""Dow AgroSciences is committed to the production and marketing of products that will help American farmers feed the world, and do so with full respect for human health and the environment, including endangered and threatened species,"" the statement said. ""These letters, and the detailed scientific analyses that support them, demonstrate that commitment."" 
FMC Corp., which sells malathion, said the withdrawal of the EPA studies would allow the necessary time for the ""best available"" scientific data to be compiled. 
""Malathion is a critical tool in protecting agriculture from damaging pests,"" the company said. 
Diazinon maker Makhteshim Agan of North America Inc., which does business under the name Adama, did not respond to emails seeking comment.

70,Who's Watching the Oil and Gas Industry in California?,rcoleman,2017-05-08,"Environmental connections to public health >> Who's Watching the Oil and Gas Industry in California? By Bill Allayaud, California Director of Government Affairs Monday, May 8, 2017 
California's well-earned reputation as the nation's greenest state, with cutting-edge policies mandate fuel efficiency and renewable energy, hides a surprising fact: California also produces the third-most oil in the country. The state's petroleum industry is regulated by an obscure agency called the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources, or DOGGR. For much of its history, DOGGR answered faithfully to Chevron and Exxon, but paid little mind to protecting drinking water, crops or communities from pollution by the array of toxic chemicals used in and produced by oil and gas operations. 
Statewide, some 90,000 oil and gas wells are actively pumping, and many of them are right where people live. Last month, Southern California Public Radio reported that DOGGR data show that in Los Angeles, approximately 90 percent of the city's oil wells are within 2,500-foot of homes, schools, parks, medical facilities and other public places. 
In the last five years, EWG's California office revealed the dysfunction at DOGGR, and helped protect the state’s surface and groundwater resources from oil drilling. This led to California’s adoption of the strongest fracking regulation in the country. Here are some highlights: 
Fracking 
Fracking, the injection of chemical-laced water deep underground to free up oil and gas deposits, has been deployed in the Los Angeles area as far back as 1953. Today, half a million Californians live within a mile of a fracked well and fracking is used to produce about one-fifth of oil in the state. But only in the last few years, as the fracking boom spread nationwide, has the danger that fracking chemicals pose to groundwater and drinking water become widely known. 
For years, DOGGR publicly denied that there was any fracking in California – until 2012, when EWG presented evidence that thousands of wells have been fracked in at least six counties: Kern, Los Angeles, Monterey, Sacramento, Santa Barbara and Ventura. This revelation focused the legislature’s attention on this agency that had grown accustomed to operating out of the public eye. 
In 2013, landmark legislation mandating the regulation of fracking was signed into state law, making California the only state to require comprehensive chemical testing of drilling waste and public disclosure of the results. Our reports and advocacy in the capital were instrumental in getting this law across the finish line. But we didn't stop there. 
Reviewing the data made available under the new law, EWG’s 2015 investigation revealed just how toxic fracking wastewater is. In addition to the known carcinogen benzene, tests of wastewater samples found chromium-6, lead and arsenic – all listed under California’s Proposition 65 as causes of cancer or reproductive harm – in one-third to half of the samples. The wastewater also carried, on average, thousands of times more radioactive radium than the state’s public health goal. 
A follow-up report assessed the human and environmental health impacts of the fracking chemicals used between 2013 and 2015. Almost 200 distinct chemicals were injected into nearly 700 oil wells, revealing the likely origin of some contaminants in the wastewater and also the array of hazardous chemicals used, stored or transported at fracking sites. These chemicals have the potential to endanger the health of oilfield workers and people who live or work nearby, and could contaminate drinking water in the underlying aquifers. 
Underground Injection of Oil and Gas Wastewater Pollutes Aquifers In 2012, investigations by EWG and other environmental advocates exposed that on the sly, DOGGR had been allowing the injection of billions of gallons of drilling wastewater into underground sources of water that could be used for domestic or agricultural purposes. This revelation led to the resignation of the director of the state Department of Conservation, which oversees DOGGR. 
But the illegal injection practice continued. In 2013, fracking and other oil and gas drilling operations in California produced more than 130 billion gallons of wastewater, injected into thousands of underground wells. Finally, in July 2014, the state ordered an emergency shutdown of 11 injection wells in Kern County, because of the risk of drinking water contamination. The next year, a dozen more wells were shut down. 
This public embarrassment for state government resulted in a renewed and stronger role for the state’s water quality enforcement agency, the Water Resources Control Board, and its regional counterparts. The new California fracking law thrust the Water Board directly into the fray. Since 2014, the Water Board oversees potential impacts of fracking on groundwater. 
As of 2017, nearly 500 wastewater injection wells have been shut down. Yet, DOGGR continues to allow injection into more than 1,650 wells across the state, and much more work needs to be done to protect California’s water resources from oil and gas wastewater. 
Oil Wastewater on Food Crops? 
In California’s Central Valley, the state's agricultural heartland, there are approximately 900 open pits that are used to dispose of billions of gallons of water from fracked wells and oil production. This wastewater percolates into the ground, polluting the underlying aquifer, and evaporates into the air, making the already dirty air in areas such as Kern County even worse. Groundwater wells can be contaminated, harming nearby farming operations. 
EWG's investigations pushed the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board to inventory all the oil wastewater disposal pits in Kern County. The results were startling. About one-third of the ponds had never received state operating permits. Just as DOGGR had turned a blind eye to extensive fracking in Kern County for decades, the Central Valley Water Board had casually allowed billions of gallons of often toxic wastewater to be dumped into open pits. 
Oil production wastewater has also been used for watering food crops without any analysis of potential impacts on public health. Our investigation found that between 2014 and 2016, more than 95,000 acres of food crops were irrigated with billions of gallons of oil field wastewater. Contaminants in the wastewater included 16 chemicals the state classifies as cancer causing or reproductive toxicants. 
The Central Valley Water Board established an expert panel to evaluate the safety of food irrigated with oil field wastewater. But more than a year later, the panel has still has not adequately addressed the lack of information on the practice. Questions remain about the chemicals used in the oilfields that produce the wastewater, inadequate water quality monitoring, limited food testing and unknown long-term impacts. EWG maintains that no further permits should be issued for spraying wastewater on food crops and that existing permits should be revoked until the practice is proven safe. 
What’s next? 
Our fight to protect food and water from oil and gas production continues. If the oil price per barrel moves toward $100 again, you can be sure that the oil and gas industry will be looking to expand farther, bringing more wells in proximity to homes and fields. Below are things to watch for in 2017 and beyond: California must require full disclosure of chemicals used in oil and gas wells for the entire time a well is operated. The Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board and its Food Safety Panel will hold hearings on the risks posed by oil field wastewater ponds to the safety of food crops. We'll be there, helping safeguard California’s food supply. The safety of oil refineries and the permanent closure of abandoned wells remain issues that must be addressed.

71,UPDATE: Algae Outbreaks Rise Sharply from Coast to Coast,rcoleman,2018-08-10,"EWG > Agmag > UPDATE: Algae Outbreaks Rise Sharply from Coast to Coast UPDATE: Algae Outbreaks Rise Sharply from Coast to Coast By Anne Weir Schechinger, Senior Analyst, Economics Friday, August 10, 2018
Outbreaks of potentially toxic algae are rising sharply this summer in lakes, rivers and streams in the U.S., according to EWG’s ongoing tracking of algae outbreaks.
When EWG last reported on the number of algae outbreaks, we counted 30 eruptions in the month of June. In the six weeks since then, 77 new outbreaks have erupted from California to New York. Through monitoring of news reports, we’ve counted 144 algae outbreaks so far this year, compared to 169 in all of last year.
EWG’s interactive algae story map shows where the outbreaks are taking place.
Many of the outbreaks have been in lakes that are hit by algae outbreaks every year, such as Utah Lake , where this week and in previous weeks health officials have urged people to keep themselves and their pets out of the water. But algae outbreaks have also erupted in places that have never experienced them before, such as Moreau Lake in New York, which was closed to recreation late last month. Utah Lake, June 27.

This summer’s algae outbreaks have poisoned drinking water in cities such as Greenfield, Iowa. Last month, Greenfield utility officials warned residents not to drink tap water after detecting an algae toxin called microcystin.
Beaches were closed to recreation at a Girl Scout camp in Rhode Island and at a Boy Scout camp in Florida . Health officials in Kern County, Calif., warned people not to go in the water of Lake Isabella . Lake Isabella, Calif., July 8. Satellite image from European Space Agency.
Algae outbreaks aren’t just a nuisance. When they produce microcystin or other toxic bacteria, they can cause sore throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or liver damage. Long-term exposure can lead to cancer or liver failure.
Algae breaks out when polluted runoff from farm fields or industrial sources gets into lakes, rivers and streams. Rain and heat amplify the pollutants to make the problem worse.
Trying to curb algae outbreaks through farmers and landowners’ voluntary measures to reduce runoff from fertilizer and manure has not worked. Farmers who can voluntarily add these measures can also voluntarily remove them whenever they like.

More than 50 agricultural workers southwest of Bakersfield, California in Kern County were inadvertently exposed to pesticide drift from a nearby field earlier this month. According to local reports , 12 farmworkers reported symptoms of vomiting, nausea and one person fainted due to exposure to Vulcan, an organophosphate -based chemical. 
Notably, the active ingredient in the insecticide is chlorpyrifos, which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) under the Trump administration decided not to ban in March. 
“Anybody that was exposed, that was here today, we encourage them to seek medical attention immediately. Don’t wait. Particularly if you’re suffering from any symptoms. Whether it’s nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, seek medical attention immediately,” Michelle Corson, public relations officer for Kern County Public Health , said. 
As the Environmental Working Group detailed, research shows that even small amounts of chlorpyrifos can damage parts of the brain that control language, memory, behavior and emotion. Multiple independent studies have documented that exposure to chlorpyrifos impairs children’s IQs and EPA scientists’ assessments of those studies concluded that levels of the pesticide found on food and in drinking water are unsafe . 
But on March 29, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt sided with the pesticide lobby over scientists in his decision to nix an Obama-era proposal to ban chlorpyrifos from use on food crops. NationofChange is reader-supported. Please do your part today. Donate or give monthly . 
“We need to provide regulatory certainty to the thousands of American farms that rely on chlorpyrifos, while still protecting human health and the environment,” Pruitt said after signing the order. “By reversing the previous Administration’s steps to ban one of the most widely used pesticides in the world, we are returning to using sound science in decision-making – rather than predetermined results.” 
Chlorpyrifos originates from a nerve gas developed by Nazi Germany. Chemical maker Dow Chemical sells about 5 million pounds of it in the U.S. each year. 
Notably, Dow donated $1 million to the presidential inauguration and the company’s CEO, Andrew Liveris, leads Trump’s advisory council on manufacturing. In February, Liveris received the signing pen after the president signed the “Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda,” an executive order aimed at eliminating regulations that Trump claims are damaging to the U.S. economy, but some worry that the measure will roll back critical environmental protections . 
The Associated Press reported in April that Dow is pressuring the Trump administration to throw out a 10,000-page government risk study on three pesticides under review, including chlorpyrifos. The government scientists found that chlorpyrifos is “likely to adversely affect” 1,778 of the 1,835 animals and plants in its study.  ",['Kern'],nationofchange.org

California regulators are proposing a strict limit on a toxic man-made chemical that has contaminated water supplies throughout the state, particularly in its vast agricultural heartland. 
California would be the second state, after Hawaii, to establish a threshold for the former pesticide ingredient and industrial solvent known as TCP (1,2,3-trichloropropane) in drinking water. The chemical compound, identified in California as a human carcinogen, is no longer in wide use but has leached over the years into many wells and reservoirs in California and other states. 
The California State Water Resources Control Board’s proposal would set the maximum allowable amount of TCP in public tap water at five parts per trillion — the lowest level that existing filtration systems can reliably detect and far lower than Hawaii’s. 
It “is a top priority for the state water board,” said board spokesman Andrew DiLuccia. 
TCP taints water systems serving nearly a million people from Sacramento to San Diego, according to the state water board. The compound is present at levels above the proposed limit in 562 wells, reservoirs and other sources belonging to 94 public water systems, according to 2016 data. Those numbers do not include private wells. 
Citing federal data, the Environmental Working Group, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy organization, says the chemical also has been detected in water supplies of a dozen other states, including New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, as well as Puerto Rico. The group, or EWG, said the extent of contamination is likely underestimated because federal tests used a contamination threshold much higher than California’s. (The federal government does not set restrictions on TCP in drinking water.) 
Once TCP gets into the groundwater, it “persists for centuries,” according to the EWG’s April report. 
In California, the contamination exists in many urban areas, including in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Mateo counties. Though the source in those more populated regions is not known, the pollution is believed to come from industrial and hazardous waste sites. 
“Los Angeles has quite a bit of contamination,” said Andria Ventura, toxics program manager for the environmental advocacy group Clean Water Action. “It’s hard for water providers to pinpoint where it came from.” 
But California’s most serious and widespread TCP contamination is in the agricultural counties of the Central Valley, where the chemical was an ingredient in soil fumigants sold by the Shell Oil and Dow Chemical companies from at least the 1950s into the 1980s. Advertisement 
During that period, farmers who grew potatoes, sugar beets and other vegetables used the fumigants to kill tiny, soil-dwelling worms called nematodes. Dozens of municipalities and public water suppliers across the state have filed lawsuits against Shell and Dow, alleging that the companies knew — or should have known — that the TCP in their soil-fumigating pesticides would migrate into groundwater and pose a serious health hazard. 
Shell and Dow have denied wrongdoing. Shell quit selling its product, known as D-D, in the mid-1980s. About the same time, Dow opted to reformulate its fumigant, known as Telone, after which TCP declined to “generally undetectable” levels, according to company spokesman Jarrod Erpelding. He declined to comment further, citing pending litigation. 
Shell sent an email response: “The former Shell agricultural product, last manufactured more than 30 years ago, contained trace amounts of 1,2,3 trichloropropane (TCP). It was used to control microscopic worms that attacked crops causing millions of dollars a year of crop loss for farmers, and was approved for use by the U.S. government and the State of California.” 
Environmental advocates say the adoption of a regulatory limit for TCP is a crucial step to help cash-strapped, rural water districts pay for the cleanup of their drinking water. 
“It allows the districts when they go into court to be very specific and say to the judge, ‘We’re going to need exactly this amount of money to purchase this kind of system to meet the state standards,’” said Bill Walker, managing editor at the Environmental Working Group and co-author of its report on the role of Shell and Dow in California’s TCP drinking water problem. 
“It doesn’t guarantee they’ll win,” he said, “but it increases their leverage.” 
At a public hearing on April 19, water board members heard testimony and received written comments on the proposed limit. Now the board is reviewing the input it received and will likely vote on the plan by summer, DiLuccia said. 
The regulation would require water utilities to test their supplies for TCP and remove it from any public drinking water source that exceeded the threshold, starting in 2018. 
The proposed limit is more stringent than Hawaii’s because it is as close as California could get to meeting its stated “public health goal” for TCP set in 2009, officials say. 
Though it is difficult to know how long the California cleanup might take, the cost of TCP testing and subsequent cleanup could reach nearly $500 million over 20 years, according to one water board estimate. 
TCP contamination “disproportionately impacts poor communities and communities of color,” said Jenny Rempel, of Community Water Center, a Visalia-based advocacy group. “This is a problem where the cost should not be borne by taxpayers.” 
Todd E. Robins, a San Francisco attorney who is representing more than two dozen of the water suppliers that are suing Shell and Dow, argues that the companies included TCP in their worm-killing pesticides to get rid of the compound without having to pay for proper disposal. It was a byproduct of unrelated manufacturing processes and, according to the suits, played no role in killing the plant-damaging worms. 
“The TCP that we find today in groundwater is the result of past use of soil fumigants that contained TCP as an unnecessary ingredient,” Robins said. “Instead of paying for disposal costs, they started getting farmers to pay for them.” 
“The saddest part of the story,” Robins added, “is that the … actual active ingredient breaks down in the soil after a matter of days and has rarely been detected in anyone’s groundwater.” 
One of the lawsuits filed by Robins, on behalf of the Del Rey Community Service District in Fresno County, says the companies knew they could remove or reduce the amount of TCP in their pesticides without compromising its effectiveness but failed to do so. 
The complaint calls TCP a “hazardous waste”— a byproduct created in the manufacturing of a different chemical, allyl chloride, that Shell and Dow used to make plastics and other commercial products. 
An internal Shell memo uncovered in Robins’ litigation cites $3.2 million in savings from “cost avoidance for disposal” related to the allyl chloride operations. The memo is dated Jan. 20, 1983 — a year before the company stopped producing the TCP-laced pesticide. 
In addition to the pending cases, which also name distributors and marketers as defendants, Robins said he has settled eight cases against both Shell and Dow since 2010. He said he cannot disclose the amounts because of confidentiality agreements. 
Last December, in a case tried by a different lawyer, a Fresno Superior Court jury awarded the city of Clovis $22 million against Shell to clean up its TCP-tainted drinking water. 
In 2010, in a case brought by the city of Redlands, Shell won. The company argued that a nearby aerospace plant was the source of the toxin. Moreover, the wells in question were used for irrigation, and the jury didn’t believe they’d ever be used for drinking water. 
As the lawsuits proceed, some California residents do what they can to protest the toxic chemicals in their water supply. Bartolo Chavez, 57, took time off his job in a juice packing house to testify at the recent hearing in Sacramento. 
“We talk about the contaminants and the danger,” said Chavez, who has lived for 21 years in the Central Valley town of Arvin, Calif. “And [that] we’re exposed.” 
He said he gets tokens from the water district to get free filtered water — not just because of TCP but because of other contaminants as well, such as arsenic and chromium-6. 
“But the tokens aren’t enough,” Chavez said, speaking through a Spanish-language interpreter. “So in addition, we buy bottled water at Costco.” 
Chavez and his wife, a hotel worker, pay about $50 a month for that water — a price they say they can ill afford. But leaving Arvin isn’t an option either, Chavez said. 
“I have thought about moving, but it’s not so easy to find work in other places, especially when you’re older,” he said. “Our house is almost paid off, and to move would be to start over again, so it’s almost impossible.”

(Courtesy of Governor’s Office) By The Editorial Board , The Daily Breeze Posted: # Comments Martha Guzman Aceves was named to the state Public Utilities Commission effective Jan. 1, 2017. (Courtesy of Governor’s Office) 
There are some indications that Clifford Rechtschaffen, one of Gov. Jerry Brown’s two latest appointments to the state Public Utilities Commission, would be more of an advocate for utilities than for consumers, ratepayers and those adversely affected by environmental issues. 
That’s why the Senate Rules Committee needs to ask tough questions of Rechtschaffen in his confirmation hearing this week. 
In December, Brown appointed two of his advisers on environmental and climate change issues, Rechtschaffen and Martha Guzman Aceves, to six-year terms as PUC commissioners. They replaced outgoing Commissioners Mike Florio and Catherine Sandoval in January. 
Rechtschaffen and Guzman Aceves will face the Rules Committee, chaired by Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León, D-Los Angeles, in their confirmation hearings Wednesday afternoon. 
The two new appointees were in place when the PUC ruled it was safe to reopen Southern California Gas Co.’s Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility at a reduced capacity less than two years after the biggest methane leak in U.S. history displaced thousands of residents from the Porter Ranch area. Los Angeles County filed suit, arguing that the facility should not be allowed to operate until an independent investigation of the cause of the leak is complete — which seems a logical approach but was spurned by the PUC. 
Liza Tucker of Consumer Watchdog sent an eight-page letter to de León , co-signed by leaders of Save Porter Ranch, Food & Water Watch, Rootskeeper and a law firm — opposing Rechtschaffen’s appointment “on the basis of Mr. Rechtschaffen’s record of favoring the oil and gas industry.” 
The letter alleges that Rechtschaffen “fired two top oil and gas regulators, Derek Chernow and Elena Miller, who were trying to make oil and gas drilling safer.” Tucker cites a legal declaration by Chernow, as part of a lawsuit against the Brown administration and oil companies that claims they poisoned Kern County aquifers, as evidence that Rechtschaffen fired the two regulators at the behest of Occidental Petroleum, which subsequently donated $500,000 to support Brown’s Proposition 30 tax measure. 
De León and the other senators on the Rules Committee need to get to the bottom of these allegations and satisfy themselves that they are groundless before confirming Rechtschaffen’s appointment. 
They need to ask Rechtschaffen why he fired and replaced the two regulators. Was there pressure from Occidental or any other petroleum company to replace them? Did pressure, if any existed, come through the governor’s office? 
And why the rush to reopen the Aliso Canyon facility? Could that decision not have been put off until the investigation of the cause of the blowout was complete? Did the decision put the financial interests of SoCalGas’s parent company, Sempra Energy, or anyone else ahead of the safety of neighboring residents? Advertisement 
The PUC’s reputation has been tarnished considerably by its failures in relation to the deadly explosion in San Bruno of a Pacific Gas & Electric gas line, and by alleged coordination between then-commission president Michael Peevey and Southern California Edison on who would pay for the San Onofre nuclear plant closure. 
The Senate committee must satisfy itself that these new PUC appointees will represent the pocketbooks and the health and safety of the people of California above the financial interests of the state’s big utilities and energy companies.  ",['Kern'],dailynews.com

Jerry Brown is no climate action hero 
By Jean Su November 14, 2017 1:00 PM Bonn, Germany 
Gov. Jerry Brown seemed surprised by what greeted him at the United Nations climate conference in Germany on Saturday. Less than a minute into his remarks, Californians living near fracking, oil refineries and Aliso Canyon stood up and decried the destruction that Brown’s industry-pandering fossil fuel polices have had on their lives. 
I bellowed with them, our collective words silencing the audience. Met with demands of “keep it in the ground” from Richmond’s refinery communities, Brown yelled back , “Let’s put you in the ground so we can get on with the show here.” Opinion 
I was shocked by Brown’s disrespectful and condescending retorts, but even more so by the crowd that cheered him on. Even at a climate change conference, the stories of impacted communities fell on deaf ears. 
Many are desperately holding onto hope that Brown will fill the Trump-sized hole in the nation’s climate leadership. But the truth is that his rhetoric on global warming hides his support for aggressive oil and gas extraction in our state. California should not be held up as a shining example for other states and countries. 
Many don’t know that California is the third-largest oil-producing state, or that oil companies extract millions of barrels every year of some of the dirtiest oil on the planet, far worse for our climate than Canada’s notorious tar sands oil. 
Even as Brown dons his climate hero cape, he’s not curbing oil extraction. California regulators issue thousands of new drilling permits each year, including a projected 2,600 new wells a year in Kern County for decades to come. 
To avert a climate catastrophe, it is urgently necessary to keep oil in the ground. Yet with toothless regulations and tax breaks, California rolls out the red carpet for oil and gas development. 
California and Pennsylvania are the only oil-producing states that do not levy a tax on extraction. Brown administration officials are relentlessly seeking exemptions from the federal Safe Drinking Water Act to allow oil companies to dump toxic fluids into underground water supplies. 
Brown has pressured regulators to speed up permitting for oil companies, firing officials who did not comply. He has refused to ban fracking despite its use of toxic chemicals and the fact that it is fundamentally incompatible with fighting climate change. And he has failed to shut down the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility, where the largest methane leak in U.S. history forced thousands to flee their homes. 
Compounding the climate damage, many California oilfields operate dangerously close to homes and schools, emitting air pollutants that cause asthma, cancer and other health problems. Fourteen percent of Californians live within a mile of an oil or gas well. Drilling occurs disproportionally in low-income communities already choked by pollution. 
The local and global damage from California’s dirty oil production demand nothing less than a rapid phase-out within the next several decades. California must ban fracking and halt permits for new drilling, fossil fuel infrastructure and oil field expansion. The state should eliminate subsidies and use the money to transition to clean energy, invest in public transportation and ban the sale of fossil fuel vehicles by 2025. 
True climate leadership starts at home. Brown, despite his global hype, is failing this test. ",['Kern'],sacbee.com
78,California proposes stringent cap on toxic chemical in drinking water,,2017-05-03,"California proposes stringent cap on toxic chemical in drinking water May 2, 2017 by Stephanie O'neill, Kaiser Health News 
California regulators are proposing a strict limit on a toxic man-made chemical that has contaminated water supplies throughout the state, particularly in its vast agricultural heartland. 
California would be only the second state, after Hawaii, to establish a threshold for the former pesticide ingredient and industrial solvent known as TCP (1,2,3-trichloropropane) in drinking water . The chemical compound, identified in California as a human carcinogen, is no longer in wide use but has leached over the years into many wells and reservoirs. 
The problem extends well beyond California and Hawaii, environmental advocates say, but the chemical is not regulated by the federal government. Citing federal data, the Environmental Working Group, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy organization, says the chemical also has been detected in water supplies of a dozen other states, including New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, as well as Puerto Rico. 
Once TCP gets into the groundwater, it ""persists for centuries,"" according to the EWG's April report. 
The California State Water Resources Control Board's proposal would set the maximum allowable amount of TCP in public tap water at five parts per trillion - the lowest level that existing filtration systems can reliably detect and far lower than Hawaii's. 
It ""is a top priority for the state water board,"" said board spokesman Andrew DiLuccia. 
TCP taints water systems serving nearly a million people from Sacramento to San Diego, according to the state water board. The compound is present at levels above the proposed limit in 562 wells, reservoirs and other sources belonging to 94 public water systems , according to 2016 data. Those numbers do not include private wells. 
In California, the contamination exists in many urban areas, including in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Mateo counties. Though the source in those more populated regions is not known, the pollution is believed to come from industrial and hazardous waste sites. 
""Los Angeles has quite a bit of contamination,"" said Andria Ventura, toxics program manager for the environmental advocacy group Clean Water Action. ""It's hard for water providers to pinpoint where it came from."" 
But California's most serious and widespread TCP contamination is in the agricultural counties of the Central Valley, where the chemical was an ingredient in soil fumigants sold by the Shell Oil and Dow Chemical companies from at least the 1950s into the 1980s. 
During that period, farmers who grew potatoes, sugar beets and other vegetables used the fumigants to kill tiny, soil-dwelling worms called nematodes. Dozens of municipalities and public water suppliers across the state have filed lawsuits against Shell and Dow, alleging that the companies knew - or should have known - that the TCP in their soil-fumigating pesticides would migrate into groundwater and pose a serious health hazard. 
Shell and Dow have denied wrongdoing. Shell quit selling its product, known as D-D, in the mid-1980s. About the same time, Dow opted to reformulate its fumigant, known as Telone, after which TCP declined to ""generally undetectable"" levels, according to company spokesman Jarrod Erpelding. He declined to comment further, citing pending litigation. 
Shell sent an email response: ""The former Shell agricultural product, last manufactured more than 30 years ago, contained trace amounts of 1,2,3 trichloropropane (TCP). It was used to control microscopic worms that attacked crops causing millions of dollars a year of crop loss for farmers, and was approved for use by the U.S. government and the State of California."" 
Environmental advocates say the adoption of a regulatory limit for TCP is a crucial step to help cash-strapped, rural water districts pay for the cleanup of their drinking water. 
""It allows the districts when they go into court to be very specific and say to the judge, 'We're going to need exactly this amount of money to purchase this kind of system to meet the state standards,'"" said Bill Walker, managing editor at the Environmental Working Group and co-author of its report on the role of Shell and Dow in California's TCP drinking water problem. 
""It doesn't guarantee they'll win,"" he said, ""but it increases their leverage."" 
At a public hearing on April 19, water board members heard testimony and received written comments on the proposed limit. Now the board is reviewing the input it received and will likely vote on the plan by summer, DiLuccia said. 
The regulation would require water utilities to test their supplies for TCP and remove it from any public drinking water source that exceeded the threshold, starting in 2018. 
The proposed limit is more stringent than Hawaii's because it is as close as California could get to meeting its stated ""public health goal"" for TCP set in 2009, officials say. 
Though it is difficult to know how long the California cleanup might take, the cost of TCP testing and subsequent cleanup could reach nearly $500 million over 20 years, according to one water board estimate. 
TCP contamination ""disproportionately impacts poor communities and communities of color,"" said Jenny Rempel, of Community Water Center, a Visalia, Calif.-based advocacy group. ""This is a problem where the cost should not be borne by taxpayers."" 
Todd E. Robins, a San Francisco attorney who is representing more than two dozen of the water suppliers that are suing Shell and Dow, argues that the companies included TCP in their worm-killing pesticides to get rid of the compound without having to pay for proper disposal. It was a byproduct of unrelated manufacturing processes and, according to the suits, played no role in killing the plant-damaging worms. 
""The TCP that we find today in groundwater is the result of past use of soil fumigants that contained TCP as an unnecessary ingredient,"" Robins said. ""Instead of paying for disposal costs, they started getting farmers to pay for them."" 
""The saddest part of the story,"" Robins added, ""is that the ... actual active ingredient breaks down in the soil after a matter of days and has rarely been detected in anyone's groundwater."" 
One of the lawsuits filed by Robins, on behalf of the Del Rey Community Service District in Fresno County, says the companies knew they could remove or reduce the amount of TCP in their pesticides without compromising its effectiveness but failed to do so. 
The complaint calls TCP a ""hazardous waste"" - a byproduct created in the manufacturing of a different chemical, allyl chloride, that Shell and Dow used to make plastics and other commercial products. 
An internal Shell memo uncovered in Robins' litigation cites $3.2 million in savings from ""cost avoidance for disposal"" related to the allyl chloride operations. The memo is dated Jan. 20, 1983 - a year before the company stopped producing the TCP-laced pesticide. 
In addition to the pending cases, which also name distributors and marketers as defendants, Robins said he has settled eight cases against both Shell and Dow since 2010. He said he cannot disclose the amounts because of confidentiality agreements. 
Last December, in a case tried by a different lawyer, a Fresno Superior Court jury awarded the city of Clovis $22 million against Shell to clean up its TCP-tainted drinking water. 
In 2010, in a case brought by the city of Redlands, Shell won. The company argued that a nearby aerospace plant was the source of the toxin. Moreover, the wells in question were used for irrigation, and the jury didn't believe they'd ever be used for drinking water. 
As the lawsuits proceed, some California residents do what they can to protest the toxic chemicals in their water supply. Bartolo Chavez, 57, took time off his job in a juice packing house to testify at the recent hearing in Sacramento. 
""We talk about the contaminants and the danger,"" said Chavez, who has lived for 21 years in the Central Valley town of Arvin, Calif. ""And (that) we're exposed."" 
He said he gets tokens from the water district to get free filtered water - not just because of TCP but because of other contaminants as well, such as arsenic and chromium-6. 
""But the tokens aren't enough,"" Chavez said, speaking through a Spanish-language interpreter. ""So in addition, we buy bottled water at Costco."" 
Chavez and his wife, a hotel worker, pay about $50 a month for that water - a price they say they can ill afford. But leaving Arvin isn't an option either, Chavez said. 
""I have thought about moving, but it's not so easy to find work in other places, especially when you're older,"" he said. ""Our house is almost paid off, and to move would be to start over again, so it's almost impossible.""",['Arvin'],phys.org
79,"The Scary Effects of Chlorpyrifos, a Chemical Approved by the EPA",Grace Lisa Scott,2017-05-16,"The Scary Effects of Chlorpyrifos, a Chemical Approved by the EPA It's highly toxic and used in pesticides across the U.S. Environment May 15, 2017 A pesticide chemical once slated to be banned by the EPA is likely responsible for the sudden illness of a group of farm workers near Bakersfield, California. On May 5, pesticides drifted over to workers harvesting cabbage from a nearby mandarin field. According to local reports , 12 people reported vomiting, nausea, and one person fainted. A representative from Kern County Department of Public Health issued a statement asking anyone exposed to the pesticide to seek medical attention immediately. “Don’t wait. Particularly if you’re suffering from any symptoms. Whether it’s nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, seek medical attention immediately,” said Michelle Corson. The pesticide contained a chemical called chlorpyrifos, which is widely known to be highly toxic. According to Mother Jones , whether chlorpyrifos was responsible for the workers’ symptoms is still under investigation, but the Kern County Department of Public Health assumes it was the active ingredient. Chlorpyrifos is used in pesticides applied to over 50 crops in the United States, including soybeans, peaches, corn, strawberries, broccoli, apples, onions, and asparagus. In other words, it’s very common. A 2016 EPA report on chlorpyrifos details how exposure to the chemical is linked to an “increased risk of delays in mental development, intelligence loss, attention problems and autism spectrum disorder in children.” Its toxicity can be harmful to anyone if it’s touched, inhaled, or eaten, and can bring on muscle twitching, lack of coordination, weakness or tremors, cramps, and blurred or darkened vision. The EPA was on its way to banning chlorpyrifos before the current administration took over. In October 2015, they announced that the residue of chlorpyrifos left on food crops exceeded safety standards set by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and in 2016 they went even further to include its harm to drinking water: 
“The majority of estimated drinking water exposures from currently registered uses, including water exposures from non-food uses, continue to exceed safe levels even taking into account more refined drinking water exposures.” But the Trump administration pulled an about-face at the end of March, when EPA Chief Scott Pruitt signed an order denying a petition to ban the chemical’s use on agriculture, citing a lack of reliable data on chlorpyrifos’s harm. 
“We need to provide regulatory certainty to the thousands of American farms that rely on chlorpyrifos, while still protecting human health and the environment,” said EPA Administrator Pruitt. “By reversing the previous Administration’s steps to ban one of the most widely used pesticides in the world, we are returning to using sound science in decision-making – rather than predetermined results.” Chlorpyrifos’s parent company, Dow Chemical, released a statement supporting Pruitt’s decision. With the EPA’s recent decision to fire scientists in order to make room for industry on its review boards, Pruitt’s decision on chlorpyrifos could be the beginning of a trend.

80,Pesticide Trump’s EPA Approved After Obama’s EPA Banned Is Poisoning People (But Just Mexicans) :(,Doktor Zoom,2017-05-17,"  If you’re in the next field over, there’s no sign… 
It was great news for Dow Chemical when Donald Trump signed that executive order in February calling for a steep reduction in federal regulations, which kill jobs and are terrible for the economy. Trump was so proud of the EO and how happy and prosperous it would make all Americans that he surrounded himself with CEOs and handed the pen to Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Dow (just past the 5-minute mark here): WATCH: President Trump signs Executive Order on Regulations pic.twitter.com/qEn6rYLX2k 
— CSPAN (@cspan) February 24, 2017 
In late April, just to make it clear he cares about the health of America’s Corporate Persons, if not any actual human beings, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt ignored the EPA’s own scientists and reversed the agency’s plan to ban agricultural use of chlorpyrifos, a very nasty pesticide produced by Dow AgroSciences. The stuff was already banned for home use in 2000, but was still legal for agriculture; Obama’s EPA had started the process of banning its use in the U.S. altogether. As Mother Jones notes, chlorpyrifos is some pretty nasty stuff: 
It’s an organophosphate, a class of bug killers that work by “interrupting the electrochemical processes that nerves use to communicate with muscles and other nerves,” as the Pesticide Encyclopedia puts it. Chlorpyrifos is also an endocrine disrupter, meaning it can cause “adverse developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune effects,” according to the National Institutes of Health. 
Major studies from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, the University of California-Davis, and Columbia University have found strong evidence that low doses of chlorpyrifos inhibits kids’ brain development, including when exposure occurs in the womb, with effects ranging from lower IQ to higher rates of autism. 
And yes, studies found it in the urine of children living near farm fields, which is why smart parents aren’t so poor they have to live near ag operations. 
On the other hand, banning the chemical would have been very bad for Dow AgroSciences, so Pruitt signed off on keeping the stuff legal. So it was a huge surprise to nobody that more than 50 farm workers were exposed to the stuff a couple of weeks ago when it drifted over from a nearby field that had been sprayed; 12 were treated for poisoning, and had symptoms like vomiting and nausea; one person fainted. One person was taken to the hospital, and a dozen of the workers had no symptoms. 
Oh, yes, and there’s this chilling line which goes without further comment in the KGET TV news report: “However more than half of the farm workers left before medical aid arrived.” So there’s the New Cruelty working from multiple directions: Legalize poisons that scientists said should be banned, and make sure that migrant workers are so frightened of La Migra that they’d risk chemical poisoning instead of getting treated and then met by ICE officers at the ER. America truly is great again, isn’t it? 
Just in case, the Kern County Public Health department put out a warning through public relations officer Michelle Corson: 
Anybody that was exposed, that was here today, we encourage them to seek medical attention immediately. Don’t wait. Particularly if you’re suffering from any symptoms. Whether it’s nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, seek medical attention immediately[.] 
Side effects of exposure may also include deportation, so weigh your options carefully. 
The TV report cited a supervisor at the farm where the workers were poisoned, who said a neighboring farm had been sprayed the previous night with an insecticide called Vulcan, whose active ingredient is chlorpyrifos. Mother Jones reported yesterday that while the Kern County Public Health Department therefore assumes chlorpyrifos is the chemical at work in the poisoning, the county’s Department of Agriculture and Measurement Standards was still investigating, and that tests to definitively identify the chemical that made the workers sick would take at least a week. 
In the meantime, Donald Trump and Dow CEO Andrew Liveris continue to be great pals. Before taking office, Trump announced Liveris would head the American Manufacturing Council, the main private sector advisory committee for the Secretary of Commerce. Then in February, just before Trump issued the Executive Order calling for broad deregulation, Liveris gushed that Trump’s administration just might be “the most pro-business administration since the Founding Fathers. There is no question that the language of business is occurring here at the White House.” It’s a beautiful partnership, and neither man has children who live near a farm that’s spraying its fields with chlorpyrifos. 
Considering how sad Donald Trump got about seeing the poor poisoned children of Syria, maybe the only hope for getting this crap off the market is to wait for another accident — there will be one — and hope the suffering is sufficiently photogenic to make it to cable news. 
But that probably won’t happen (the poisoning will, Trump caring about it won’t), and besides, lots of the people who are likely to be affected by this nightmare chemical are here illegally. Maybe it’ll be a good incentive for them to self-deport! Say, you know who else used a poisonous insecticide to get rid of a disfavored group of people?

81,California legislators must formulate constructive water policies,Heliya Izadpanah,2017-06-05,"California legislators must formulate constructive water policies Xinyu Li/Senior Staff By Heliya Izadpanah | Special to the Daily Cal Last Updated 14 hours Ago 
Californians are in deep water — dirty water, to be more precise. Over half a million residents are neglected the same basic access to clean drinking water enjoyed by the rest of the state. Hardest hit are children ( a quarter of California schools fail to meet water provision standards ) and farmworkers in the Central Valley , particularly low-income Latino communities . 
The toxic groundwater in these communities often features lovely chemicals such as arsenic, pesticides, uranium, bacteria, nitrates and even carcinogens . As a result, citizens have higher cancer rates, higher obesity rates (a result of substituting soda for tap water), higher birth defect rates (from contaminated water consumption) and overall shorter lives. 
Farmworkers in the Valley who want safe water are often obligated to drive about an hour away to purchase bottled water after spending sweltering days sweating in arid fields. Spending about 10 percent of their paychecks on this basic commodity, hard-pressed families are sometimes forced to forego bottled water for cheaper sodas, or to drink contaminated water and bare the health consequences. 
It is an absolute abomination that in a state where agriculture accounts for 80 percent of water use, about 95 percent of farmworkers are neglected access to safe tap water. As with many situations, money, policy and political pull provide structural causes. 
Small communities do not have sufficient funds for adequate water treatment systems. To get the money, they need to be incorporated into county districts. Fatally, counties can refuse to incorporate small towns if they do not seem like “profitable” additions to their jurisdictions. Counties deem these districts as “non-viable,” pointing to shortages of preexisting public facilities and services in these areas. By “non-viable” they mean that the communities have brief futures and “do not need” long-term water infrastructure. 
Tulare County’s 1971 General Plan acutely captures this attitude, describing how water infrastructure is purposely withheld from the community in order to trigger “a process of long-term, natural decline.” In other words, community planners intend to bleed these small communities dry by withholding infrastructure. While the communities suffer as water quality worsens, life persists. Many neglected Central Valley populations and their residents remain for generations — water or no water. 
Yet the entire premise of “viability” is anathemic to human rights and sound governance. It is neither fair nor equal. Guaranteeing access to safe water is not something that should be decided based on income, demonstrable wealth or political pull. 
Furthermore, while California has emergency water funds, it neglects to use the money to provide clean water for all of its residents. Apparently, saving the water for communities that experience the inconvenience of short-term water shortages is more important than ensuring everyone has some water to begin with. 
If impacted communities were composed of upper-class white residents, they would never be denied clean water. High tax brackets alone would provide sufficient incentive for counties to incorporate the communities. If for some reason, tax margins had failed as motivation, the political influence and law degrees inherent in wealthy, non-marginalized communities would mandate change. 
To make matters worse, President Trump began the month by announcing his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. While Michael Bloomberg’s plan to finance the United State’s commitment to the international treaty is economically promising, it is insufficient in providing the nation with the policy directive needed to transition to a water-wise future. Failure to implement necessary mitigation and adaptation infrastructure will result in continued desertification and rising freshwater scarcity. In a state where a majority of food is grown in an already arid climate, Trump’s inaction will exacerbate the problem. Current trends promise a future filled with higher food prices and further damage to the livelihood, health and life quality of our food growers. 
Our state itself must act up. California has the eighth largest economy in the world and a brimming reserve of emergency water funding. Clean water can definitely become a reality for all. As California residents, we need to pressure local and state officials to provide equitable clean water access. Community planners, particularly throughout the Central Valley, must prioritize protecting vulnerable populations, rather than class composition. Legislators must continue formulating constructive water policies and allocate sufficient funding towards potable water projects. 
These changes are completely feasible. Community groups such as the AGUA Coalition have already encouraged legislators to pass numerous constructive measures. For instance, Senate Bill 1263 outlawed small water agencies, with the goal of incentivizing new communities to integrate into large water districts rather than attempting to set up their own system. Similarly, Senate Bill 552 permits the State Water Resources Control Board to hire independent contractors to aid struggling communities to develop clean water systems and long-term sustainability plans. 
Getting clean water to all Californians is completely doable. Let us keep the flow of change steady, tap into our coffers and open the floodgates. It is time to thank the people who feed us with the water they deserve. Heliya Izadpanah is a rising third year studying society and environment with a concentration in justice and sustainability.

82,The Dangers Lurking in California School Drinking Fountains,Sasha Abramsky,2017-07-08,"Environment The Dangers Lurking in California School Drinking Fountains It has become too risky for tens of thousands of children in the San Joaquin Valley to drink water at their schools due to chronic contamination by chemicals, pesticides, and other toxins. Avatar: Social count: 10 It has become too risky for tens of thousands of children in the San Joaquin Valley to drink water at their schools due to chronic contamination by chemicals, pesticides, and other toxins. 10 SHARES (Photo: Tara Lohan) 
Reef-Sunset Unified School District Superintendent David East is worried about water. Not because of the drought—record rains this past winter ended five years of dry times. Rather, East, whose district encompasses the small towns of Avenal and Kettleman City on the San Joaquin Valley's west side, is worried about the safety of the water that the 2,700 students in his school district are being given to drink. 
That's because arsenic levels in the drinking water at some schools in the San Joaquin Valley exceed the maximum federal safety levels by as much as three times . And arsenic is not the only threat to schoolchildren. High levels of pesticides, nitrate, bacteria, and naturally occurring uranium also contaminate groundwater in many rural parts of the state. 
In East's district, his Kettleman City school exceeds the safe level of arsenic. And for schools in Avenal, the problem is high levels of trihalomethanes, a disinfectant byproduct that forms when chlorine that is used to treat the water reacts with organic matter in the water. Although naturally occurring, arsenic can be dangerous, especially to children. According to the National Institutes of Health, arsenic is a known carcinogen and exposure to arsenic as a child is associated with the higher risk of later developing cancer. And trihalomethanes may also be carcinogenic, according to the State Water Resources Control Board . 
""Imagine growing up in a community where you can't drink the water and you go to school and you can't drink the water—that sets you up to think that's the way life is,"" says Susana De Anda, the co-founder and co-executive director of the Community Water Center , which works on ensuring clean water for all Californians. ""Everyone should be able to drink tap water without the fear of getting sick. Those are not the conditions you want to condemn future generations to live in."" 
In 2015, the Lucile Packard Foundation for Children's Health mapped out water quality violations reported to the California Environmental Protection Agency. The researchers found that of the roughly 1,600 public water violations throughout the Central Valley, 40 percent of them were clustered in just four San Joaquin Valley counties—Kern, Madera, Fresno, and Tulare. 
""The San Joaquin Valley has the highest concentration of water pollution in schools,"" says Ari Neumann, assistant director of the Rural Community Assistance Corporation , which works with state agencies and non-profit organizations to expand access to safe drinking water in California, with an emphasis on communities of fewer than 20,000 people. ""There are some schools where they've turned off the water because they know of contamination."" 
A report published by the Community Water Center and the Environmental Justice Coalition for Water assessed the threat that schools face from contaminated water. Some schools receive water from public water agencies in the area and some have their own groundwater wells. Comparing state water quality data to the location of schools, the study found that, in 2003–14, between 500,000 and one million schoolchildren lacked access to safe drinking water. One in four Central Valley schools received contaminated water, while one in three did so in the Tulare Lake region. 
""Bacterial and arsenic violations were the most common types of violations impacting schools, followed by the pesticide DBCP, disinfectant byproducts and nitrates,"" the report found. ""Some had recurring problems for more than a decade."" 
Large water districts routinely treat and filter their water to eliminate such hazards. But in the San Joaquin Valley and other rural regions of California, residents either rely on private wells or small districts that lack the funds and infrastructure to treat contaminated drinking water. 
Researchers found that 52 percent of schools that rely on their own water systems suffered water quality problems, compared to just 12 to 23 percent of schools using public water systems. 
""You just can't drink any of the water,"" says Jennifer Hedge, superintendent of the two-school Rio Bravo-Greeley Union School District, which serves roughly 1,100 students, outside of Bakersfield in Kern County. Because of elevated nitrate levels, ""cooking is done with bottled water. There are no drinking fountains,"" she says. Hedge's schools are currently being fitted with a water treatment system. The project has, to date, cost about $70,000.

(Photo: Rural Community Assistance Corporation) Funding Solutions 
California's state government has, in recent years, tried to tackle this problem—most recently with new legislation that approved $9.5 million in funding for the Drinking Water for Schools Grant Program. Over the coming years this money will be used to install safe water systems in schools in disadvantaged communities. 
Arvin, a disadvantaged community of 20,000 that sits at the southern end of Kern County, has been dealing with high levels of arsenic for years. 
""I came here in the summer of 2010 as superintendent,"" Michelle McClean says. ""I was met by a group of community members called Committee for a Better Arvin. They began talking to me about poor water quality—higher levels of arsenic and fertilizers."" 
In 2008 the Environmental Protection Agency cited Arvin Community Services District, which provides drinking water for the city and schools, for exceeding the maximum contaminant level for arsenic. The water district was given two years to fix the problem and then granted another four-year extension, which it still failed to meet. Arvin's water has tested as high as three times above the level deemed safe by state and federal standards. 
While the water district looked for new sources of clean water for the community, the school districts worked with the state and local non-profits to find an interim solution—point-of-use filters that can be hooked up to water sources like drinking fountains or sinks to remove contaminants such as arsenic and lead. 
Dave Wallis, the technical services program manager at RCAC, says the group has helped install more than 170 filters in the Arvin area since 2015, including in six schools in three local school districts that serve nearly 6,000 students. 
The installation of filters was accompanied by public education, says Jerry Tinoco of RCAC, who is helping to implement the interim school drinking water program. Tinoco grew up in Arvin but at the time arsenic wasn't considered an issue. He says everyone regularly drank from the tap. The maximum contaminant level set by the federal government was 50 parts per billion then. But in 2001, after research concluded the standard didn't adequately protect public health, the arsenic standard was lowered to 10 parts per billion, which put Arvin out of compliance. 
But now, he says, ""there has been great effort to educate the public about arsenic in the water."" And he's been part of that effort. 
""After we installed the filters initially, we had an assembly where we talked to the students about where their water comes from, what arsenic is—letting them know they should try to avoid drinking water from the tap at home,"" Tinoco says. ""We've had a series of public workshops and there are parents that are very worried about it because kids are more susceptible to some of the things that arsenic causes."" 
The effects have been positive so far. ""We've seen the water consumption going up in the schools,"" Wallis says. ""It's good to see. We're approaching providing 200,000 gallons of filtered water down there. Having a six-year-old come up to you and ask if he's allowed to drink the water and you can say, 'Yes you are'—that's really been a great thing."" 
But safe water at schools is only part of the issue for kids in Arvin. McClean also worries that the children are drinking unsafe water at home. She pushed for a partnership with Agua4All , a coalition of community groups, to give all residents water bottles that could be filled easily and cheaply, with filtered water at filling stations that have also been installed at various locations in town. 
Since then, student attendance in Arvin's schools has gone up, McClean says, and she believes annual physical fitness test results for students have also improved as fewer students have been drinking only sodas and more have begun drinking water on a regular basis. 
""It's great having the kids get the water they like to drink, and it's helping out the overall health of everybody down there,"" Wallis says.

The health of his students is a primary concern for David East in Avenal as well. 
Avenal is a sleepy little community. A sign in town announces it to be ""the pistachio capital of the world."" There's a lot of produce grown around there, yet precious little of it makes its way into local stores, says East, who bemoans the fact that the choice of vegetables to buy is limited to ""iceberg lettuce and cabbage."" Nearly all of his students are poor enough to qualify for assistance programs for school lunch. 
Anisha Patel, associate professor of pediatrics at University of California–San Francisco School of Medicine, says dangerous water represents an ongoing environmental justice catastrophe. In poor counties of the San Joaquin Valley, she said that half of all kids ""are overweight or obese by the time they're in fifth grade. And if they don't trust the water, they're not going to drink it."" Instead, she says, they may resort to drinking sugary sodas as their default liquids. 
For years, locals in Avenal have shied away from tap water—even before they knew about unsafe levels of disinfectant byproducts—bemoaning its taste and its rusty appearance, and digging into what little money they had to buy five-gallon jugs of bottled water, according to East. 
But things are improving there too. Although food in Avenal schools is still cooked in the cafeteria with bottled water, over the past year, using grant money provided by a local agricultural produce company—the Wonderful Company—schools have installed point-of-use water fountains. These shiny metal fountains each have their own sophisticated reverse osmosis filter system. And state funding has been used in East's Kettleman City school to treat arsenic with point-of-use filters. 
Gradually, as a result, the students have begun drinking water again, East and his principals believe. But restoring confidence in public water systems takes time too. 
George Lopez, a custodian in the district, says, he's gotten into the habit of only drinking bottled water, and East himself says the same thing. Despite all the investments in safe water systems, he prefers the taste of bottled water, and he still fears the contaminants in local tap water.

83,How Water Contamination Is Putting California's San Joaquin Valley at Risk,Robin Meadows,2017-07-08,"Environment How Water Contamination Is Putting California's San Joaquin Valley at Risk More than one million people in the San Joaquin Valley region have been exposed to unsafe drinking water in recent years from pesticides, arsenic, nitrate, and uranium. And many communities also face multiple environmental health threats.

Nearly all Californians get clean, safe drinking water delivered to their homes. But, according to state data , turning on the tap is risky for more than one million people in the San Joaquin Valley, where drinking water is among the most contaminated nationwide, according to government testing. And some residents don't even know it, as testing of private wells is not required and some water agencies fail to provide customers with required water quality reports or it's in a language they can't read. 
Most affected are small, rural communities, which are disproportionately poor and Latino. Long-term fixes are in the works but many solutions will take years to implement—not enough funding is available for the people who need help immediately. 
The majority of residents in the San Joaquin Valley rely on groundwater for some or all of their drinking water, and many California groundwater basins are contaminated with a mix of manmade and naturally occurring toxicants. The former include nitrate and legacy pesticides, which persist in the environment long after first introduced, and the latter include arsenic and uranium.

Most water suppliers can bring groundwater up to health standards by treating it or blending it with water from cleaner sources. But some communities get all their water from contaminated aquifers and can't afford to treat it properly, which can threaten public health, according to a report by the State Water Resources Control Board . In Tulare County, for instance, contaminated groundwater is the source of drinking water for 99 percent of the population. 
Nitrate is one of the state's most widespread groundwater contaminants, according to research from the University of California–Davis , which reported that nitrate-contaminated groundwater poses public-health risks for approximately 254,000 people living in two of the biggest agricultural areas of the state: the San Joaquin Valley's Tulare Lake Basin and the Salinas Valley. California set the drinking water standard for nitrate in 1962 and has regulated water quality since 1969. 
Nitrate is an inorganic compound formed when nitrogen combines with oxygen or ozone. Low levels can occur naturally in groundwater, but high levels of nitrate in groundwater are often attributed to fertilizers, septic systems, animal feedlots, or industrial waste, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
In California, the state is only just starting to address the primary source of this contaminant in the San Joaquin Valley's groundwater: the Valley's five million acres (two million hectares) of farmland. A study led by Thomas Harter and Jay Lund of UC–Davis found that, in the state's main agricultural counties, 96 percent of the human-generated nitrate in groundwater came from cropland. The biggest sources were synthetic fertilizer (54 percent) and animal manure (33 percent). Fertilizer application followed by irrigation drives excess nitrate down through the soil and into aquifers. 
Nitrate can be dangerous to human health, especially for infants. It limits the oxygen that red blood cells carry, a condition known as methemoglobinemia or ""blue baby syndrome,"" which can result in lethargy, dizziness, and death. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has also concluded that nitrates are a probable human carcinogen . 
The San Joaquin Valley is particularly hard hit by nitrate: 63 percent of the state's public water systems that report violations of health standards for the contaminant in 2015 were in the Valley. ""Nitrate is the most critical, the most immediate contaminant in the San Joaquin Valley,"" Harter says. Carlos Arias, district manager for the small community of Del Rey, California, in the San Joaquin Valley, stands near one of the community's water wells. Del Rey has 1,2,3-Trichloropropane in its water, a contaminant recognized by the state to cause cancer, but not yet regulated. (Photo: Tara Lohan) 
When Harter began studying the contaminant as a graduate student in the 1980s, his advisor called nitrate an old problem ""from the 1950s."" Why has nitrate taken so long to regulate? For one thing, agriculture was exempt from water quality regulations until 2003. Moreover, it's hard to determine the source of nitrate pollution in the Valley. ""There's an endless string of fields across the landscape,"" Harter says. ""It's unclear who's contributing how much."" 
State regulators are in the second year of a program to help keep agricultural nitrate out of groundwater in the Central Valley. The idea is for farmers to track applications of fertilizer, which contains nitrate, and yields of crops, which consume nitrate as they grow. The difference between the two is the amount of leftover nitrate that can leach into groundwater. 
But even if nitrate stopped seeping into groundwater completely, so much has already entered the soil that it will still be a problem for years to come, according to the UC–Davis report. ""We understand the urgency—but we need science-based solutions,"" says Sue McConnell, chief of the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board's Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program. ""What we're doing now will help protect future generations."" 
Other major human sources of groundwater contaminants in the San Joaquin Valley include pesticides that are banned but still linger in the environment. Notably, the fumigant 1,2-Dibromo-3-Chloropropane (DBCP) was banned in California in 1977 but continues to contaminate groundwater. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, DBCP is classified as a probable carcinogen and chronic exposure to can decrease sperm counts. The San Joaquin Valley has three of the four California counties with the highest DBCP levels, which are triple that deemed to be safe by the state. 
Contaminants that occur naturally are even more prevalent in San Joaquin Valley groundwater. One of the most harmful is arsenic, which can cause blindness and partial paralysis , and is linked to cancer. In 2015, 60 percent of the state's public water systems reporting health violations for arsenic were in the Valley, and Madera County drinking water has the highest levels of arsenic statewide. Another naturally occurring toxicant found in the soil is uranium. Madera County drinking water has the state's highest levels of uranium at more than three times the health standard. 
Another source of water contamination are the 1,000 or so unlined pits in which the oil industry disposes of wastewater, which can contain toxic metals, benzene, and radioactive substances. Like California's petroleum industry, these pits are concentrated in Kern County and more than 400 of them lack the required state permits necessary to operate, according to the state water board. Without proper management, unlined pits can threaten groundwater quality, the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board reports. Trucks enter an oilfield in Kern County. San Joaquin Valley residents face a range of health issues, including air pollution from vehicles and industry in the region. (Photo: Tara Lohan) 
Then there are contaminants that are not yet regulated, such as 1,2,3-Trichloropropane (1,2,3-TCP). A solvent found in industrial or hazardous waste sites, 1,2,3-TCP is recognized by California as a carcinogen. This toxicant was also added to two soil fumigants manufactured by Dow Chemical and Shell that were widely used by farmers for decades in the San Joaquin Valley. In 2016, 63 percent of California public water systems that detected this carcinogen were in the Valley. 
Jonathan Nelson grew up in Bakersfield, and didn't know he'd been drinking 1,2,3-TCP-contaminated water his whole life. He only found out when he started working as policy director at the Community Water Center, which advocates for safe drinking water in the San Joaquin Valley, and he realized his town was one that had found the contaminant in its drinking water. Now, thanks partly to his own efforts and his colleagues at the Community Water Center who have lobbied the state for 1,2,3-TCP to be regulated, state officials are expected to announce a maximum contaminant level for 1,2,3-TCP in drinking water this year. 
Nelson says drinking water advocates estimate a capital funding need of up to a billion dollars, which would need to be addressed in a future water bond. Another need is an ongoing operations and maintenance fund ranging up to a few hundred million annually, which advocates hope to address through S.B. 623 —a bill that has passed the state senate and is before the assembly. ""California is the sixth largest economy in the world,"" Nelson says. ""But people lack safe drinking water in our own backyard."" 
Even when drinking water contains known toxins, it can be hard to prove that any single one affects people's health. One reason is size—impacted communities can be too small for tracking cancer rates or birth defects, says John Capitman, executive director of the Central Valley Health Policy Institute and professor of public health at California State University–Fresno. 
Another obstacle: Many Valley residents face contaminants from multiple sources . People who drink polluted water can also breathe polluted air and be exposed to toxic chemicals from pesticide applications , industrial facilities, and hazardous waste landfills . 
And the impact of these multiple health burdens is unknown. ""We don't know how air pollution impacts the body differently from water pollution or how multiple effects work out,"" Capitman says. ""That is a whole new area of science that is absent yet. How do we understand exposure over time and exposure to multiple sources of pollutants? There is huge work to be done in that area.""

84,The Fight for Groundwater in California's San Joaquin Valley,Mark Grossi,2017-07-07,"Drought conditions continue for thousands of rural residents in the San Joaquin Valley who rely on groundwater, and the race to dig deeper wells is a losing game.
Homeowner Leonicio Ramirez and daughter Tania Ramirez are the first residents to receive water through a water distribution system in East Porterville, California, on August 19th, 2016. Engineers at the California Department of Water Resources designed a system to deliver water from the city of Porterville to 1,800 homes in its neighboring community to the east. Evelyn Rios wept in 2014 when the well went dry at her home of 46 years—the home where she and husband Joe raised five children on farm-worker wages. They cannot afford another well, so they do without. Her angst only grew as California's five-year drought dragged on.
Finally, after one of the wettest winters on record, Governor Jerry Brown announced in April that the drought had ended. But the situation remains grim, says Rios, 80, who lives in rural Madera County in California's San Joaquin Valley. She thought she was being hooked up to the city of Madera's water system. Now the emergency money for such projects has dried up.
""So, the drought is over?"" she asks. ""What about us? What about the plans to hook up to Madera's water? How long will we have to wait now? The drought might be over for you, but it isn't over for me.""
Full reservoirs and swollen rivers don't mean that much to people living in rural San Joaquin Valley, where about 1,000 people still have dry wells. Their water sits underground in the nation's second-largest groundwater aquifer, which was mined and dramatically drawn down by farmers protecting the valley's $40 billion-a-year agriculture industry.
Legislation passed in 2014 will help regulate groundwater pumping, but it will be at least two decades before the law is fully implemented, leaving communities vulnerable to further groundwater shortages and having to compete with big farms digging deeper wells. In addition, many of those people live in small, unincorporated communities, which often lack the resources to properly maintain community water systems.
Waiting years for safe drinking water has now become a way of life in the valley. It's one more stress for people who live in California's most vulnerable social and environmental conditions. They face contaminated water, dirty air, lack of health care, and language barriers, according to a state environmental screening tool called CalEnivroScreen .
People of color in this farm country die up to 15 years sooner than people who live in more affluent areas of Fresno, according to the Central Valley Health Policy Institute at Fresno State.
Many of these rural residents will still be without reliable water this year while the rest of California debates landscape watering rules.
The state is trying not to abandon people with dry wells. Starting July 1st, an additional year of free water will be delivered to massive tanks that were placed at many dwellings with dry wells, including the Rios' home.
Which only raises more questions, say water advocates in Central California. One year won't be enough time to fix all the problems out there. What will happen afterward? Will the state continue to buy water?
""And what will happen should any new homes run out of water during the next year?"" asks Jenny Rempel, director of education and engagement for the non-profit advocacy group Community Water Center . ""There is not nearly enough funding for everyone with a dry well to get a grant or even loan assistance since the existing funding is massively oversubscribed.""
Emergency drought spending already amounts to $27 million in the Central Valley, paying for everything from a new well in East Porterville to food subsidies, says spokesman Kelly Huston of the state Office of Emergency Services. Other state agencies, such as the Department of Water Resources and the State Water Resources Control Board, will continue working to get water for residents, he says, whether there is a drought or not.
But things moved faster during the drought emergency. Advocates say the one-year additional year of emergency water funding might elapse during the application process for state bond money, and projects might take another year to complete.
""You have to go through a longer process without the emergency,"" says Maria Herrera of Visalia-based Self Help Enterprises , which has helped rural residents build and repair homes for decades. ""That's not a good solution if you've been waiting for years already.""
Herrera works with Tulare County residents, including those in Monson, where about 200 residents have never had access to a central water system—just private wells. Many are expected to be connected to a distribution system this year to get water from a new public well. But Monson has been waiting since 2008 when contamination was found in private wells.
""The new well is right across the street from my house,"" says resident Lazara Luengas. ""We might have water by the end of August. Maybe I'll start my yard up again. It's so hard to live without water in your home. I don't have the words to say how grateful we are to Self Help.""
In the small, unincorporated community of Seville in the San Joaquin Valley, a new well was installed during the drought, but old infrastructure still hampers the distribution of clean water. Tulare County has been at the epicenter of private dry wells, and the number of failing wells is beginning to diminish. Still, there are hundreds of problems left to resolve.
The drought crisis brought together government agencies, non-profits, and community groups as never before, says Eric Coyne, deputy county administrator.
About 800 homes will be hooked up to water soon in East Porterville, where more than 7,000 people went dry a few years ago, Coyne says. About $40 million from state and federal sources will be spent in the process.
""I've never seen a project of this scale put together in the time frame that we have,"" he says. ""It was engineered in less than six months.""
Fixes come in all sizes and shapes. In Seville, north of Visalia, residents got a replacement for the failing and contaminated town well. But the new well delivers much higher water pressure, stressing ancient pipes—some are older than the Titanic, Coyne says. The distribution system needs to be rebuilt.
Even as millions of dollars are invested and the water comes back to many homes, residents know wells could go dry again if groundwater pumping ramps up. A Sacramento Bee investigation found a record 2,500 wells were drilled in San Joaquin Valley in 2015 during the height of the drought. The state passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act in 2014, but it won't fully kick in until 2040.
During the drought, trillions of gallons of water were pumped without being replaced in the Central Valley, one recent study in Geophysical Research Letters shows . And farmers continue to invest in almond orchards, which cannot be fallowed during dry periods.
Vickie Ortiz, whose well is dry in Fairmead, south of Chowchilla in Madera County, says she respects her farm neighbor. But if her neighbor drills down 1,000 feet for water, it probably will eventually dry up any new, shallower well that she might get.
""We're finding new almond plantings all around here now,"" she says. ""To the right of my five-acre parcel, there are 30 acres of almonds. Behind me, there's another 20 acres. When his well goes dry, he's going to dig deeper. Then I'll have to dig deeper. And I'll still have a loan on the well I've got. No, this is not going to end until somebody is monitoring it.""

85,"1,2,3 TCP a cancer-causing chemical plagues California drinking water",,2017-07-28,"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 15:02 UTC © ACLU of Northern California In the Central Valley of California, hundreds of wells that provide water to a million people are tainted with a chemical that some experts say is one of the most powerful cancer-causing agents in the world. The state is poised to take the first step Tuesday to regulate the substance - called 1,2,3, TCP - but test data compiled by an activist group show it's also been detected by utilities across the country. Some who live in this lush farmland believe it's to blame for the health problems of their family members and neighbors. ""The word that really captures all of it is 'outrage,'"" said Jerry Tinoco, 45, who is from the city of Arvin and says at least three close family members have been diagnosed with cancer. ""It's a man-made chemical, so someone is to blame."" There's no research showing the chemical has caused cancer spikes in specific communities, but some residents and experts told NBC News that research simply has yet to be done in towns like Arvin. How dangerous is TCP? The Environmental Protection Agency has concluded it's ""likely to be carcinogenic to humans,"" and the California water board warns residents not to shower with tainted water because they might inhale the chemical. Paul Tratnyek, a professor at the Institute of Environmental Health at Oregon Health and Science University who studied TCP for the Defense Department, said few other chemicals match its toxicity. ""Even the slightest amount of TCP in the water would be considered to be a potential health effect,"" Tratnyek said. NBC News was in Arvin as the city tested the water for TCP. A state-certified lab found more than six times the amount the state says is acceptable. ""Arvin is poor. But they deserve to live,"" local resident Maggie Medina said. ""They deserve clean water. They didn't create this problem."" TCP is a degreasing agent used in the production of plastic products. Lawyer Todd Robbins says the chemical's presence in water supplies across California's Central Valley is largely attributable to two industrial giants that recycled TCP by packaging it with agricultural pesticides. ""TCP got into drinking water in the Central Valley because Dow Chemical Company and Shell Oil Company saw an opportunity decades ago to take a hazardous waste stream at their chemical plants, put it in barrels and sell it to farmers, who would then inject it into the ground,"" Robbins said. Comment: Shell and Dow chemical hid 1,2,3 TCP cancer-causing chemical in pesticides, contaminating drinking water for millions ""That's how it started."" Robbins represents 30 communities that are suing Dow and Shell to get them to pay for the multi-million dollar filtration process required to clean water supplies. The companies prevailed in a 2010 lawsuit filed by the city of Redlands, California, but they have settled other suits and recently lost their first, to a Central Valley city two hours north of Arvin. A jury awarded Clovis, California, $22 million to treat contaminated water and remove TCP from its wells. Among the documents Robbins has collected is an internal memo in which Dow scientists called TCP ""garbage,"" acknowledging that it had little utility in killing pests. Another memo, from Shell, raises concerns about the chemical's toxicity to animals. ""By at least 1970, the companies knew that it posed a direct risk to groundwater, were advised by their own internal engineers and scientists to do something about it, and they failed to do so,"" he said. Dow and Shell declined requests for interviews, and Dow declined to comment. In a statement, Shell said that the product in question has been out of use for years, that it contained only ""trace amounts"" of TCP and that it was approved by the federal and California governments. The company added that the product was ""beneficial"" and that TCP was also present in other products, made by other companies. The companies also point out there have been no studies that prove TCP causes cancer in humans. But Jenny Rempel of the Community Water Center, an advocacy group, said animal studies are frequently used to set public health standards. In fact, that's what California relied on when it set the level at which water providers must inform residents of contamination. Now, the state is going beyond that, with the water board scheduled to vote on whether to would require cleanup efforts once TCP reaches a certain threshold. The precedent set by California on Tuesday could be important nationwide. The Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization, collected data from water utilities nationwide and concluded that TCP has been detected in at least 17 states, serving millions of people. EWG currently lists 13 on its website, but will be updating the list to include four more states .",['Arvin'],sott.net
86,California to tax drinking water,,2017-08-27,"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 19:56 UTC © Press Telegram In this Sept. 18, 2015 photo, a man loads a truck on farmland near Fresno, Calif. U.S. officials with the Geological Survey’s Sacramento office and elsewhere believe the amount of uranium increased in Central Valley drinking-water supplies over the last 150 years with the spread of farming. Sacramento - For the first time Californians would pay a tax on drinking water, 95 cents per month, under legislation to fix hundreds of public water systems with unsafe tap water - a problem that's most pervasive in rural areas with agricultural runoff. Senate Bill 623, backed by a strange-bedfellows coalition of the agricultural lobby and environmental groups but opposed by water districts, would generate $2 billion over the next 15 years to clean up contaminated groundwater and improve faulty water systems and wells. ""My message is short and direct: We are not Flint, Michigan,"" co-author Sen. Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, said at a Wednesday rally outside the Capitol, where demonstrators held signs reading ""Clean water is not a luxury"" and ""Water is a human right."" Ironically, many Californians are more aware of the crisis in Flint - where state and local officials in 2015 told residents about lead contamination in the drinking water, after claiming it was safe to drink - than about the water problems in their home state, said the measure's main author, Sen. Bill Monning, D-Monterey. He called this ""a pivotal time in our state's history to do the right thing."" SB 623 has been moving through the Legislature for months, but was amended Monday to include the tax on water for both homes and businesses. It also imposes taxes on farms and dairies, roughly $30 million annually, to address some of the contamination caused by fertilizers and other chemicals. Because it includes new taxes, the proposal will need a two-thirds vote in each house to pass, which supporters concede will be a battle. Still, Monning has been able to forge the unusual alliance of farmers and environmental groups, which rarely agree on public policy. He also has the support of at least one Republican lawmaker: Sen. Andy Vidak, a cherry farmer who said his Central Valley district - which includes Hanford, Fresno and Bakersfield - is the epicenter of the drinking-water problem. ""This is very, very important to my constituents,"" he said after the rally, as some of them began chanting on the Capitol steps. ""This is one of the most important things in my district."" But water agencies say taxing drinking water sets a dangerous precedent and that the bill would turn them into state tax collectors. ""Water is essential to life. Should we tax drinking water? We don't think so,"" said Cindy Tuck, a spokeswoman for the Association of California Water Agencies. Sue Stephenson, a spokeswoman for the Dublin San Ramon Services District, said she supported the intent of the proposal - potable drinking water for all - but argued that lawmakers should use the money in existing coffers. ""The whole purpose of the general fund is to help take care of disadvantaged communities,"" she said. ""There's no reason that they could not also fund communities that need access to drinking water."" Marie Barajas, of San Jose, had a similar reaction. ""That's not fair. We're not responsible for that,"" she said. ""That's why we pay taxes."" Monning, however, argues that the general fund isn't a reliable funding source and that the proposed tax on households, amounting to roughly $11.40 per year, is negligible. ""You're not going to notice it on your water bill,"" he said. The bill is now relegated with hundreds of others in the ""suspense file"" of the Assembly Appropriations Committee. The panel must decide by Sept. 1 to move it to the Assembly floor for a vote. Selerina Chavez took a day off from work to drive from the Kern County city of Arvin for the rally. She said she hoped lawmakers would try to fix the problem posing health risks to her family and her neighbors, many of whom are farm workers or living on fixed incomes. When she moved from Ventura County more than 20 years ago, she said, it never occurred to her that the water would be unsafe for her family to drink. They drank it for years, she said, before she learned a few years ago that it contained unsafe levels of arsenic. ""I thought about my children,"" she said in Spanish. ""How many years have we been drinking this water?"" In addition to her regular water bill, she spends $40 per week buying drinking water. She also buys water for cooking. Now, she said, ""I have three water bills."" SENATE BILL 623 What is it?: SB 623, by Sen. Bill Monning, D-Monterey, would generate $2 billion over 15 years for a Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund, which would provide emergency water and longer-term system fixes for hundreds of communities whose tap water doesn't meet safe drinking-water standards. Where would the money come from? The proposal would generate roughly $110 million per year through a 95-cent monthly fee on home water bills as well as taxes on businesses of up to $10 per month. Another $30 million would come from higher fees on agricultural and dairy businesses, industries whose chemicals contribute to the problem of contaminated groundwater. Who's for it?: Who's against it? The bill is backed by the agriculture and dairy lobbies, as well as by a long list of environmental, social justice and civic groups - an unusual combo. Water districts are against the bill, saying that taxing water users creates a bad precedent and that collecting the money would be burdensome. Will it pass?: If the Assembly Appropriations Committee moves the bill to the floor, it needs a two-thirds vote of each house, which is always a challenge. What's more, Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes has faced intense blow-back for his bipartisan collaboration to extend California's landmark climate program, called ""cap and trade."" But SB 623 does have one Republican co-author: Sen. Andy Vidak, of Hanford.

88,First-ever water tax proposed to tackle unsafe drinking water in California,Anonymous,2017-08-28,"First-ever water tax proposed to tackle unsafe drinking water in California
http://www.presstelegram.com/article/LB/20170...
For the first time Californians would pay a tax on drinking water, 95 cents per month, under legislation to fix hundreds of public water systems with unsafe tap water  a problem thats most pervasive in rural areas with agricultural runoff.
Senate Bill 623, backed by a strange-bedfellows coalition of the agricultural lobby and environmental groups but opposed by water districts, would generate $2 billion over the next 15 years to clean up contaminated groundwater and improve faulty water systems and wells.
My message is short and direct: We are not Flint, Michigan, co-author Sen. Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, said at a Wednesday rally outside the Capitol, where demonstrators held signs reading Clean water is not a luxury and Water is a human right.
Ironically, many Californians are more aware of the crisis in Flint  where state and local officials in 2015 told residents about lead contamination in the drinking water, after claiming it was safe to drink  than about the water problems in their home state, said the measures main author, Sen. Bill Monning, D-Monterey. He called this a pivotal time in our states history to do the right thing.
SB 623 has been moving through the Legislature for months, but was amended Monday to include the tax on water for both homes and businesses. It also imposes taxes on farms and dairies, roughly $30 million annually, to address some of the contamination caused by fertilizers and other chemicals. Because it includes new taxes, the proposal will need a two-thirds vote in each house to pass, which supporters concede will be a battle.
Still, Monning has been able to forge the unusual alliance of farmers and environmental groups, which rarely agree on public policy. He also has the support of at least one Republican lawmaker: Sen. Andy Vidak, a cherry farmer who said his Central Valley district  which includes Hanford, Fresno and Bakersfield  is the epicenter of the drinking-water problem.
This is very, very important to my constituents, he said after the rally, as some of them began chanting on the Capitol steps.This is one of the most important things in my district.
But water agencies say taxing drinking water sets a dangerous precedent and that the bill would turn them into state tax collectors.Water is essential to life. Should we tax drinking water? We dont think so, said Cindy Tuck, a spokeswoman for the Association of California Water Agencies.
Sue Stephenson, a spokeswoman for the Dublin San Ramon Services District, said she supported the intent of the proposal  potable drinking water for all  but argued that lawmakers should use the money in existing coffers.
The whole purpose of the general fund is to help take care of disadvantaged communities, she said.Theres no reason that they could not also fund communities that need access to drinking water.
Marie Barajas, of San Jose, had a similar reaction.Thats not fair. Were not responsible for that, she said.Thats why we pay taxes.
Monning, however, argues that the general fund isnt a reliable funding source and that the proposed tax on households, amounting to roughly $11.40 per year, is negligible.Youre not going to notice it on your water bill, he said.
The bill is now relegated with hundreds of others in the suspense file of the Assembly Appropriations Committee. The panel must decide by Sept. 1 to move it to the Assembly floor for a vote.
Selerina Chavez took a day off from work to drive from the Kern County city of Arvin for the rally. She said she hoped lawmakers would try to fix the problem posing health risks to her family and her neighbors, many of whom are farm workers or living on fixed incomes.","['Kern', 'Arvin']",topix.com
89,"For many California communities, drinking water crisis rooted in isolation",upi.com,2017-07-06,"1 of 4 SANGER, California, July 6 (UPI) -- Carolina Garcia is a gracious hostess, offering visitors baked goods still warm from the oven and peaches picked fresh from her back yard, which is a tightly packed homestead of fruit trees, grapevines and tomatoes. Bandannas wave along a laundry line, like a colorful flag, and behind the woodpile are constantly chattering chickens and a vocal trio of sheep.
Inside, the modest one-story house bustles with family. Garcia and her husband have four children, with another on the way - a household she describes as humble but happy.
They are lacking just one crucial thing: clean drinking water.
The Garcias live in a small neighborhood of about four blocks called Tombstone Territory, an unincorporated community in Fresno County in California's San Joaquin Valley. The name gives it a Wild West feel, but it is less than 1 mile from the town of Sanger, population 25,000, and 2.5 miles from the nearest Starbucks.
When it comes to water, however, it feels pretty isolated. Unlike Sanger, which has a centralized community water system, Tombstone residents including the Garcias rely on private wells. Three months ago the family learned that the water they pump from their well had levels of nitrate above state health standards and high levels of bacteria, the latter likely to be the result of faulty septic systems in the neighborhood. Nitrates can be especially dangerous and even deadly for infants because they decrease the ability of their blood to carry oxygen.
Now the Garcias rely on bottled water for drinking and cooking, buying as much as they can afford. ""We buy all the necessary food for our children and we buy the water. But that might mean we buy less food for our children,"" Garcia says.
They are not alone. As thousands of wells began coughing up dust during California's five-year drought, a problem bigger than water shortages came into focus: Many communities in the state lack clean, safe drinking water; some have done so for many years.
This is not just a problem for people with private wells, like the Garcias. Across California more than 1.5 million people rely on drinking water from a community system that has a water quality violation that could impact public health, according to an estimate by the state using 2015 data.
But that number fails to capture the complexity of the problem.
First, it doesn't count people like the Garcias. There are some 2 million private well owners in California who are not regulated by the state and therefore are not required to test their wells and report any violations. The Garcias did not know that their well was contaminated until a local nonprofit agency, concerned about water quality in the area, knocked on their door and asked to test their supply.
Second, it does not differentiate between sporadic and chronic water problems. The number of people lacking safe drinking water consistently, not just intermittently, is much lower. The heart of the state's problem boils down to about 200,000 people served by roughly 300 water systems, according to Kurt Souza, assistant deputy director for the Division of Drinking Water at the State Water Resources Control Board.
This number is much smaller than the 1.5 million people affected by water quality violations each year, because many of those violations were short-lived, explains Souza, with some lasting only one day.
By contrast those 300 systems, ""either need a new source [of water], to be connected to a compliant water system or they need a treatment plant,"" he says. ""They don't go in and out of compliance, they are out of compliance all the time and they need something to fix it.""
To understand why a wealthy state like California, the world's sixth-largest economy, has so many people going without one of life's most basic necessities, we have to look at why there is a lack of access to safe drinking water, and why it persists.
All over the map 
If you ask Californians who live in communities with unsafe drinking water how bad things are, they will tell you in no uncertain terms that the situation is a crisis. But unlike the nation's most visible water crisis in Flint, Mich. -- where 98,000 people were drinking water tainted with high lead levels for two years before the full story came to light -- California's drinking water problems do not exist in one central location or involve one culprit contaminant. The state's problem didn't begin on a particular date and even the number of people feeling the impact changes over time.
If you look at a website the SWRCB launched this year called the Human Right to Water Portal, which tracks the 300 or so chronic offenders, you can see California's problems are literally all over the map, stretching nearly 1,000 miles from Calexico on the Mexico border to Crescent City in the north of the state. Unlike an earthquake or flood, the drinking water catastrophe did not strike suddenly but has been a slow-motion disaster unfolding over decades.
In some cases the water quality problems stem from agricultural pesticides no longer in use but still found in groundwater, such as 1,2-Dibromo-3-Chloropropane, classified as a probable carcinogen. In other cases they are the result of slowly accumulating levels of naturally occurring elements such as arsenic, which over time can cause blindness, paralysis and, potentially, cancer at high levels of exposure. Or they result from the gradual breakdown of infrastructure - leaking pipes, collapsing wells.
The problems are heavily concentrated in low-income communities of color, especially in the San Joaquin Valley, the southern half of California's 450 mile-long Central Valley and the epicenter of the state's $47 billion-a-year agricultural industry. There and in the Salinas Valley, nitrate is one of the biggest water contaminants; it infiltrates into groundwater when nitrogen is applied to cropland either through fertilizers or animal waste, according to a report from the University of California, Davis.
Other agriculture-intensive areas are hard hit, too, like the eastern Coachella Valley in Riverside County, where water systems serving a concentration of small mobile home parks housing farmworker families lack the infrastructure to treat arsenic and bacterial contaminants in their water.
There are some areas that you might not expect to see on the map, too - water systems in the wealthy Silicon Valley enclave of Palo Alto made the list, as did the wine-growing capital of Napa. The water systems had problems with disinfectant byproducts - chemicals formed when chlorine used to treat water reacts with organic matter. Two kinds of disinfectant byproducts occur most frequently in California - trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, which the state says have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals and ""may produce similar effects in people.""
For all the diversity of problems and locations, there is one common denominator: These repeat violations are most prevalent in small water systems.
The vast majority of Californians, more than 35 million people, get their water from one of about 400 urban water systems that serve populations of at least 10,000 people. And the vast majority of Californians drink clean, safe water.
But close to a half a million people get their water from one of about 600 water systems, which serve just 300 to 1,500 people each. A further 166,000 people are connected to nearly 1,000 water systems serving just 75 to 300 people each. It's these smaller systems that are most problematic.
""Small community water systems typically lack the infrastructure and economies of scale of larger water systems, and in some cases cannot afford to treat or find alternative supplies for a contaminated drinking water source,"" an SWRCB report found. ""As a result, small community water systems may be more vulnerable to serving contaminated groundwater to their customers than larger water systems.""
Treating water to eliminate contaminants can be beyond the financial means of small systems, especially when health standards change. For instance, since the federal government in 2001 changed the maximum limit for arsenic from 50 parts per billion to 10 parts per billion, small water systems have struggled to comply with the new standard, which requires expensive treatment.
""And some of these same small systems will be hit with another regulation for 1,2,3-trichloropropane (1,2,3-TCP) later this year,"" says Souza, noting that the state is preparing to set a health standard for a contaminant it identified as carcinogenic in 1992. The contaminant was found in industrial solvents and two now-defunct fumigants that were used by Central Valley farmers.
""This is not just an issue of science and engineering, it's an issue of adequate resources and leadership capacity,"" says Susana De Anda, the co-founder and co-executive director of the Community Water Center, which advocates in California for clean drinking water as a human right.
Life at the margins 
""This is Third World living standards - this is California, this is the United States,"" says Becky Quintana, describing life in her hometown of Seville, a small rural community of fewer than 500 residents in eastern Tulare County in the hulking shadow of the Sierra Nevada mountains, just 30 miles from the entrance to Sequoia National Park.
Seville has a gas station with a convenience store, an elementary school and a water well. From Quintana's home you can see the community's well - a large metal tank and some pumps - cordoned off by a chain-link fence. Behind that runs an irrigation ditch filled with murky water and some trash, and running through the middle of the ditch is Seville's water pipeline, one that is prone to leaks. Bacterial problems from dilapidated infrastructure have plagued the community for years, says Quintana. Notices advising boiling water are common, as are taps running dry intermittently during summer months and, since 2008, unsafe levels of nitrate.
Problems in tiny Seville were so bad that in 2011 it was one of only a handful of places in the United States visited by Catarina de Albuquerque, an independent expert appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council, who was investigating unsafe drinking water and sanitation conditions.
As bad as things are in Seville, the situation is more the norm than the exception. There are 310,000 people living in 525 low-income, unincorporated communities in the San Joaquin Valley where water quality problems are common. Being unincorporated means the communities lack a municipal government and often other basic services like streetlights, paved roads, emergency services and clean drinking water.
Many of the hardest-hit communities are in areas of persistent poverty, where generations of residents haven't been able to get a leg up. A Congressional Research Service report in 2005 found residents in the San Joaquin Valley were poorer than those in central Appalachia.
Sixty-five percent of the population of these unincorporated communities are people of color and 64 percent are low-income, according to a 2013 report from the nonprofit PolicyLink.
Some of these unincorporated communities, called ""island"" or ""fringe"" communities, are near cities, even surrounded by them, but they have not been annexed into the cities' borders and lack the services that urban areas provide. Others are considered ""legacy"" communities, which are in more remote areas, typically where people moved to be close to farm field jobs. Some of these communities even began as labor camps for farm workers, such as Rich Grove, Woodville and Farmersville, says Tom Collishaw, chief executive of the nonprofit Self-Help Enterprises, which has spent more than 40 years aiding rural residents in the valley.
Over the last century the communities have been built and shaped by a changing cast of arrivals, beginning with Dust Bowl migrants from places like Oklahoma, and African-American farmers from the South. Later arrivals included seasonal farmworkers from Mexico, Japanese Americans released from World War II internment camps and, more recently, refugees from Laos and elsewhere.
African-American communities such as Home Garden and Teviston ""were places that were formed because people were not welcomed [in other communities] so they lived outside and became unincorporated communities,"" says Collishaw. ""The communities have changed over time, now they may be all Mexican-Americans, but the valley is speckled with those kinds of communities.""
An article in the California Law Review of 2012 by Camille Pannu, now director of the Water Justice Clinic at the University of California, Davis School of Law, sums up the situation: ""The exclusion of communities of color and low-income white communities from the valley's cities was not incidental - it was often an intentional policy choice, reinforced through de jure and de facto race- and class-based segregation.""
As evidence of this in practice, De Anda points to the Tulare County General Plan from the early 1970s, which called out 15 communities - 13 of which are still around - as having ""little or no authentic future"" and cited an explicit policy to essentially force them out of existence. ""These non-viable communities would, as a consequence of withholding major public facilities such as sewer and water systems, enter a process of long-term, natural decline as residents depart for improved opportunities in nearby communities,"" the plan reads.
Seville, Quintana's hometown, was among those listed. ""That's an intentional discriminatory policy written in the books and, frankly, implemented,"" says De Anda. ""That's a cheat sheet for me as an organizer to go door-knocking and tell them, 'It's not a coincidence that you don't have safe drinking water in your community.'""
Clean water on the way 
On a June day, you can see the still snow-capped peaks of the Sierra Nevada from the front yard of Quintana's family home, a reminder of why irrigation ditches are running full as they pass through Seville.
Decades ago, California managed to engineer a highly complex system of water conveyance to funnel snowmelt hundreds of miles through canals, reservoirs and pumps to transform arid land into one of the world's most productive farming regions. But it's a water system designed to feed the farms of the valley and the cities of southern California, not the region's rural communities. The water runs right by them.
In Tulare County, 40 of 41 community systems are reliant on contaminated groundwater as their sole source of drinking water. When small systems cannot meet health standards because they lack funds to treat contaminated water, residents are forced to either take a risk and drink water from the tap or spend twice for water - once for dirty water they can't drink and once for bottled water.
Lucy Hernandez lives in West Goshen in Tulare County, a community where the water is contaminated by high levels of nitrate. ""We're to the point where we tell our kids not to drink too much water,"" she says. ""We either buy shoes for kids or water bottles. It shouldn't get to that point. If we had safe drinking water that's money we'd use for our families."" Hernandez says she has been spending $60 to $70 a month on bottled water for her family of seven, in addition to the regular water utility bill.
Goshen was recently able to connect to nearby Visalia's water system. In Seville, Quintana sees a light at the end of the tunnel as a nearly decade-long battle to hook Seville up to neighboring Yettem's water system is expected to be completed this year. But almost 10 years without safe water is too long, she says.
""We've always had these problems. We always addressed our [county] board of supervisors, but we were just people from a little community and we were really ignored for a lot of years. But the more people you get involved, other communities, you have a bigger voice and people do listen.""
In tiny Tombstone Territory, Carolina Garcia dreams of connecting her home's water to the town of Sanger next door. And she wants her rural community to have access to the same services that cities enjoy.
""If we were connected with Sanger we wouldn't have so many obstacles against us, we wouldn't have to struggle to get these resources,"" she says. ""I just want people to know our needs out here and the services that we are lacking. We are out here in a rural area and hope they don't forget about us.""
Thanks in part to the drought, the willingness of local residents to organize and the advocacy of nonprofit groups, the San Joaquin Valley's drinking water problems are no longer a secret. And there is movement in Sacramento from legislators and regulators to fund solutions. But cleaning up chronically contaminated water in 300 communities will take time and money. A lot of money.
Drinking water advocates are pushing for a new bill to provide several hundred million dollars annually to address ongoing operations and maintenance issues for water systems, but Jonathan Nelson of the Community Water Center says upward of $1 billion could also be required upfront for capital investments.
At least, now, more people who live in the communities are helping to shape the conversation of what those solutions look like.
""It's important to recognize that just because you are low-income, or a person of color, or speak Spanish, you shouldn't have to live in this reality,"" says De Anda. ""The current condition in California is a systemic problem and we need to address it from the root.""

90,Living in California’s San Joaquin Valley may harm your health,upi.com,2017-07-06,"1 of 4 July 6 (UPI) -- Nearly all Californians get clean, safe drinking water delivered to their homes. But, according to state data, turning on the tap is risky for more than 1 million people in the San Joaquin Valley, where drinking water is among the most contaminated nationwide, according to government testing. And some residents don't even know it, as testing of private wells is not required and some water agencies fail to provide customers with required water quality reports or it's in a language they can't read.
Most affected are small, rural communities, which are disproportionately poor and Latino. Long-term fixes are in the works but many solutions will take years to implement - not enough funding is available for the people who need help immediately.
The majority of residents in the San Joaquin Valley rely on groundwater for some or all of their drinking water, and many California groundwater basins are contaminated with a mix of man-made and naturally occurring toxicants. The former include nitrate and legacy pesticides, which persist in the environment long after first introduced, and the latter include arsenic and uranium.
Most water suppliers can bring groundwater up to health standards by treating it or blending it with water from cleaner sources. But some communities get all their water from contaminated aquifers and can't afford to treat it properly, which can threaten public health, according to a report by the State Water Resources Control Board. In Tulare County, for instance, contaminated groundwater is the source of drinking water for 99 percent of the population.
Nitrate is one of the state's most widespread groundwater contaminants, according to research from the University of California, Davis, which reported that nitrate-contaminated groundwater poses public health risks for approximately 254,000 people living in two of the biggest agricultural areas of the state: the San Joaquin Valley's Tulare Lake Basin and the Salinas Valley. California set the drinking water standard for nitrate in 1962 and has regulated water quality since 1969.
RELATED For many California communities, drinking water crisis rooted in isolation Nitrate is an inorganic compound formed when nitrogen combines with oxygen or ozone. Low levels can occur naturally in groundwater, but high levels of nitrate in groundwater are often attributed to fertilizers, septic systems, animal feedlots or industrial waste, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In California, the state is only just starting to address the primary source of this contaminant in the San Joaquin Valley's groundwater: the Valley's 5 million acres of farmland. A study led by Thomas Harter and Jay Lund of U.C. Davis found that in the state's main agricultural counties, 96 percent of the human-generated nitrate in groundwater came from cropland. The biggest sources were synthetic fertilizer (54 percent) and animal manure (33 percent). Fertilizer application followed by irrigation drives excess nitrate down through the soil and into aquifers.
Nitrate can be dangerous to human health, especially for infants. It limits the oxygen that red blood cells carry, a condition known as methemoglobinemia or ""blue baby syndrome,"" which can result in lethargy, dizziness and death. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has also concluded that nitrates are a probable human carcinogen.
The San Joaquin Valley is particularly hard hit by nitrate: 63 percent of the state's public water systems that report violations of health standards for the contaminant in 2015 were in the Valley. ""Nitrate is the most critical, the most immediate contaminant in the San Joaquin Valley,"" Harter says.
When Harter began studying the contaminant as a graduate student in the 1980s, his adviser called nitrate an old problem ""from the 1950s."" Why has nitrate taken so long to regulate? For one thing, agriculture was exempt from water quality regulations until 2003. Moreover, it's hard to determine the source of nitrate pollution in the Valley. ""There's an endless string of fields across the landscape,"" Harter says. ""It's unclear who's contributing how much.""
State regulators are in the second year of a program to help keep agricultural nitrate out of groundwater in the Central Valley. The idea is for farmers to track applications of fertilizer, which contains nitrate, and yields of crops, which consume nitrate as they grow. The difference between the two is the amount of leftover nitrate that can leach into groundwater.
But even if nitrate stopped seeping into groundwater completely, so much has already entered the soil that it will still be a problem for years to come, according to the U.C. Davis report. ""We understand the urgency ­- but we need science-based solutions,"" says Sue McConnell, chief of the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board's Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program. ""What we're doing now will help protect future generations.""
Other major human sources of groundwater contaminants in the San Joaquin Valley include pesticides that are banned but still linger in the environment. Notably, the fumigant 1,2-Dibromo-3-Chloropropane was banned in California in 1977 but continues to contaminate groundwater. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, DBCP is classified as a probable carcinogen and chronic exposure to can decrease sperm counts. The San Joaquin Valley has three of the four California counties with the highest DBCP levels, which are triple that deemed to be safe by the state.
Contaminants that occur naturally are even more prevalent in San Joaquin Valley groundwater. One of the most harmful is arsenic, which can cause blindness and partial paralysis, and is linked to cancer. In 2015, 60 percent of the state's public water systems reporting health violations for arsenic were in the Valley, and Madera County drinking water has the highest levels of arsenic statewide. Another naturally occurring toxicant found in the soil is uranium. Madera County drinking water has the state's highest levels of uranium at more than three times the health standard.
Another source of water contamination are the 1,000 or so unlined pits in which the oil industry disposes of wastewater, which can contain toxic metals, benzene and radioactive substances. Like California's petroleum industry, these pits are concentrated in Kern County and more than 400 of them lack the required state permits necessary to operate, according to the state Water Board. Without proper management, unlined pits can threaten groundwater quality, the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board reports.
Then there are contaminants that are not yet regulated, such as 1,2,3-Trichloropropane. A solvent found in industrial or hazardous waste sites, 1,2,3-TCP is recognized by California as a carcinogen. This toxicant was also added to two soil fumigants manufactured by Dow Chemical and Shell that were widely used by farmers for decades in the San Joaquin Valley. In 2016, 63 percent of California public water systems that detected this carcinogen were in the Valley.
Jonathan Nelson grew up in Bakersfield, and didn't know he'd been drinking 1,2,3-TCP-contaminated water his whole life. He only found out when he started working as policy director at the Community Water Center, which advocates for safe drinking water in the San Joaquin Valley, and he realized his town was one that had found the contaminant in its drinking water. Now, thanks partly to his own efforts and his colleagues at the Community Water Center who have lobbied the state for 1,2,3-TCP to be regulated, state officials are expected to announce a maximum contaminant level for 1,2,3-TCP in drinking water this year.
Nelson says drinking water advocates estimate a capital funding need of up to a billion dollars, which would need to be addressed in a future water bond. Another need is an ongoing operations and maintenance fund ranging up to a few hundred million annually, which advocates hope to address through S.B. 623 - a bill that has passed the state Senate and is before the Assembly. ""California is the sixth-largest economy in the world,"" Nelson says. ""But people lack safe drinking water in our own back yard.""
Even when drinking water contains known toxins, it can be hard to prove that any single one affects people's health. One reason is size - impacted communities can be too small for tracking cancer rates or birth defects, says John Capitman, executive director of the Central Valley Health Policy Institute and professor of public health at California State University, Fresno.
Another obstacle: Many Valley residents face contaminants from multiple sources. People who drink polluted water can also breathe polluted air and be exposed to toxic chemicals from pesticide applications, industrial facilities and hazardous waste landfills.
And the impact of these multiple health burdens is unknown. ""We don't know how air pollution impacts the body differently from water pollution or how multiple effects work out,"" Capitman says. ""That is a whole new area of science that is absent yet. How do we understand exposure over time and exposure to multiple sources of pollutants? There is huge work to be done in that area.""

92,Contaminated water challenges schools in California's San Joaquin Valley,,2017-07-07,"Home / Top News / U.S. News Contaminated water challenges schools in California's San Joaquin Valley It's too risky for tens of thousands of children in the San Joaquin Valley to drink water at their schools due to chronic contamination by chemicals, pesticides and other toxins. By Sasha Abramsky, Water Deeply | July 7, 2017 at 11:37 AM Comments 
July 7 (UPI) -- AVENAL, CALIFORNIA -- Reef-Sunset Unified School District Superintendent David East is worried about water. Not because of the drought - record rains this past winter ended five years of dry times. Rather, East, whose district encompasses the small towns of Avenal and Kettleman City on the San Joaquin Valley's west side, is worried about the safety of the water that the 2,700 students in his school district are being given to drink. 
That's because arsenic levels in the drinking water at some schools in the San Joaquin Valley exceed the maximum federal safety levels by as much as three times. And arsenic is not the only threat to schoolchildren. High levels of pesticides, nitrate, bacteria and naturally occurring uranium also contaminate groundwater in many rural parts of the state. 
In East's district, his Kettleman City school exceeds the safe level of arsenic. And for schools in Avenal, the problem is high levels of trihalomethanes, a disinfectant byproduct that forms when chlorine that is used to treat the water reacts with organic matter in the water. Although naturally occurring, arsenic can be dangerous, especially to children. According to the National Institutes of Health, arsenic is a known carcinogen and exposure to arsenic as a child is associated with the higher risk of later developing cancer. And trihalomethanes may also be carcinogenic, according to the State Water Resources Control Board. 
""Imagine growing up in a community where you can't drink the water and you go to school and you can't drink the water - that sets you up to think that's the way life is,"" says Susana De Anda, the co-founder and co-executive director of the Community Water Center, which works on ensuring clean water for all Californians. ""Everyone should be able to drink tap water without the fear of getting sick. Those are not the conditions you want to condemn future generations to live in."" 
In 2015, the Lucile Packard Foundation for Children's Health mapped out water quality violations reported to the California Environmental Protection Agency. The researchers found that of the roughly 1,600 public water violations throughout the Central Valley, 40 percent of them were clustered in just four San Joaquin Valley counties - Kern, Madera, Fresno and Tulare. 
""The San Joaquin Valley has the highest concentration of water pollution in schools,"" says Ari Neumann, assistant director of the Rural Community Assistance Corporation (RCAC), which works with state agencies and nonprofit organizations to expand access to safe drinking water in California, with an emphasis on communities of fewer than 20,000 people. ""There are some schools where they've turned off the water because they know of contamination."" 
A report published by the Community Water Center and the Environmental Justice Coalition for Water assessed the threat that schools face from contaminated water. Some schools receive water from public water agencies in the area and some have their own groundwater wells. Comparing state water quality data to the location of schools, the study found that in 2003-14 between 500,000 and 1 million schoolchildren lacked access to safe drinking water. One in four Central Valley schools received contaminated water, while one in three did so in the Tulare Lake region. 
""Bacterial and arsenic violations were the most common types of violations impacting schools, followed by the pesticide DBCP, disinfectant byproducts and nitrates,"" the report found. ""Some had recurring problems for more than a decade."" 
Large water districts routinely treat and filter their water to eliminate such hazards. But in the San Joaquin Valley and other rural regions of California, residents either rely on private wells or small districts that lack the funds and infrastructure to treat contaminated drinking water. 
Researchers found that 52 percent of schools that rely on their own water systems suffered water quality problems, compared to just 12 to 23 percent of schools using public water systems. 
""You just can't drink any of the water,"" says Jennifer Hedge, superintendent of the two-school Rio Bravo-Greeley Union School District, which serves roughly 1,100 students, outside of Bakersfield in Kern County. Because of elevated nitrate levels, ""cooking is done with bottled water. There are no drinking fountains,"" she says. Hedge's schools are currently being fitted with a water treatment system. The project has, to date, cost about $70,000. 
Funding Solutions 
California's state government has, in recent years, tried to tackle this problem - most recently with new legislation that approved $9.5 million in funding for the Drinking Water for Schools Grant Program. Over the coming years this money will be used to install safe water systems in schools in disadvantaged communities. 
Arvin, a disadvantaged community of 20,000 that sits at the southern end of Kern County, has been dealing with high levels of arsenic for years. 
""I came here in the summer of 2010 as superintendent,"" Michelle McClean says. ""I was met by a group of community members called Committee for a Better Arvin. They began talking to me about poor water quality - higher levels of arsenic and fertilizers."" 
In 2008 the United States Environmental Protection Agency cited Arvin Community Services District, which provides drinking water for the city and schools, for exceeding the maximum contaminant level for arsenic. The water district was given two years to fix the problem and then granted another four-year extension, which it still failed to meet. Arvin's water has tested as high as three times above the level deemed safe by state and federal standards. 
While the water district looked for new sources of clean water for the community, the school districts worked with the state and local nonprofits to find an interim solution - point-of-use filters that can be hooked up to water sources like drinking fountains or sinks to remove contaminants such as arsenic and lead. 
Dave Wallis, the technical services program manager at RCAC, says the group has helped install more than 170 filters in the Arvin area since 2015, including in six schools in three local school districts that serve nearly 6,000 students. 
The installation of filters was accompanied by public education, says Jerry Tinoco of RCAC, who is helping to implement the interim school drinking water program. Tinoco grew up in Arvin but at the time arsenic wasn't considered an issue. He says everyone regularly drank from the tap. The maximum contaminant level set by the federal government was 50 parts per billion then. But in 2001, after research concluded the standard didn't adequately protect public health, the arsenic standard was lowered to 10 parts per billion, which put Arvin out of compliance. 
But now, he says, ""there has been great effort to educate the public about arsenic in the water."" And he's been part of that effort. 
""After we installed the filters initially, we had an assembly where we talked to the students about where their water comes from, what arsenic is - letting them know they should try to avoid drinking water from the tap at home,"" says Tinoco. ""We've had a series of public workshops and there are parents that are very worried about it because kids are more susceptible to some of the things that arsenic causes."" 
The effects have been positive so far. ""We've seen the water consumption going up in the schools,"" says Wallis. ""It's good to see. We're approaching providing 200,000 gallons of filtered water down there. Having a 6-year-old come up to you and ask if he's allowed to drink the water and you can say, 'yes you are' - that's really been a great thing."" 
But safe water at schools is only part of the issue for kids in Arvin. McClean also worries that the children are drinking unsafe water at home. She pushed for a partnership with Agua4All, a coalition of community groups, to give all residents water bottles that could be filled easily and cheaply, with filtered water at filling stations that have also been installed at various locations in town. 
Since then, student attendance in Arvin's schools has gone up, McClean says, and she believes annual physical fitness test results for students have also improved as fewer students have been drinking only sodas and more have begun drinking water on a regular basis. 
""It's great having the kids get the water they like to drink, and it's helping out the overall health of everybody down there,"" says Wallis. 
Threats Across the Valley 
The health of his students is a primary concern for David East in Avenal, as well. 
Avenal is a sleepy little community. A sign in town announces it to be ""the pistachio capital of the world."" There's a lot of produce grown around there, yet precious little of it makes its way into local stores, says East, who bemoans the fact that the choice of vegetables to buy is limited to ""iceberg lettuce and cabbage."" Nearly all of his students are poor enough to qualify for assistance programs for school lunch. 
Anisha Patel, associate professor of pediatrics at University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, says dangerous water represents an ongoing environmental justice catastrophe. In poor counties of the San Joaquin Valley, she said that half of all kids ""are overweight or obese by the time they're in fifth grade. And if they don't trust the water, they're not going to drink it."" Instead, she says, they may resort to drinking sugary sodas as their default liquids. 
For years, locals in Avenal have shied away from tap water ­- even before they knew about unsafe levels of disinfectant byproducts - bemoaning its taste and its rusty appearance, and digging into what little money they had to buy five-gallon jugs of bottled water, according to East. 
But things are improving there, too. Although food in Avenal schools is still cooked in the cafeteria with bottled water, over the past year, using grant money provided by a local agricultural produce company - the Wonderful Company - schools have installed point-of-use water fountains. These shiny metal fountains each have their own sophisticated reverse osmosis filter system. And state funding has been used in East's Kettleman City school to treat arsenic with point-of-use filters. 
Gradually, as a result, the students have begun drinking water again, East and his principals believe. But restoring confidence in public water systems takes time, too. 
George Lopez , a custodian in the district, says, he's gotten into the habit of only drinking bottled water, and East himself says the same thing. Despite all the investments in safe water systems, he prefers the taste of bottled water, and he still fears the contaminants in local tap water.

93,"For many California communities, drinking water crisis rooted in isolation",upi.com,2017-07-06,"1 of 4 SANGER, California, July 6 (UPI) -- Carolina Garcia is a gracious hostess, offering visitors baked goods still warm from the oven and peaches picked fresh from her back yard, which is a tightly packed homestead of fruit trees, grapevines and tomatoes. Bandannas wave along a laundry line, like a colorful flag, and behind the woodpile are constantly chattering chickens and a vocal trio of sheep.
Inside, the modest one-story house bustles with family. Garcia and her husband have four children, with another on the way - a household she describes as humble but happy.
They are lacking just one crucial thing: clean drinking water.
The Garcias live in a small neighborhood of about four blocks called Tombstone Territory, an unincorporated community in Fresno County in California's San Joaquin Valley. The name gives it a Wild West feel, but it is less than 1 mile from the town of Sanger, population 25,000, and 2.5 miles from the nearest Starbucks.
When it comes to water, however, it feels pretty isolated. Unlike Sanger, which has a centralized community water system, Tombstone residents including the Garcias rely on private wells. Three months ago the family learned that the water they pump from their well had levels of nitrate above state health standards and high levels of bacteria, the latter likely to be the result of faulty septic systems in the neighborhood. Nitrates can be especially dangerous and even deadly for infants because they decrease the ability of their blood to carry oxygen.
Now the Garcias rely on bottled water for drinking and cooking, buying as much as they can afford. ""We buy all the necessary food for our children and we buy the water. But that might mean we buy less food for our children,"" Garcia says.
They are not alone. As thousands of wells began coughing up dust during California's five-year drought, a problem bigger than water shortages came into focus: Many communities in the state lack clean, safe drinking water; some have done so for many years.
This is not just a problem for people with private wells, like the Garcias. Across California more than 1.5 million people rely on drinking water from a community system that has a water quality violation that could impact public health, according to an estimate by the state using 2015 data.
But that number fails to capture the complexity of the problem.
First, it doesn't count people like the Garcias. There are some 2 million private well owners in California who are not regulated by the state and therefore are not required to test their wells and report any violations. The Garcias did not know that their well was contaminated until a local nonprofit agency, concerned about water quality in the area, knocked on their door and asked to test their supply.
Second, it does not differentiate between sporadic and chronic water problems. The number of people lacking safe drinking water consistently, not just intermittently, is much lower. The heart of the state's problem boils down to about 200,000 people served by roughly 300 water systems, according to Kurt Souza, assistant deputy director for the Division of Drinking Water at the State Water Resources Control Board.
This number is much smaller than the 1.5 million people affected by water quality violations each year, because many of those violations were short-lived, explains Souza, with some lasting only one day.
By contrast those 300 systems, ""either need a new source [of water], to be connected to a compliant water system or they need a treatment plant,"" he says. ""They don't go in and out of compliance, they are out of compliance all the time and they need something to fix it.""
To understand why a wealthy state like California, the world's sixth-largest economy, has so many people going without one of life's most basic necessities, we have to look at why there is a lack of access to safe drinking water, and why it persists.
All over the map
If you ask Californians who live in communities with unsafe drinking water how bad things are, they will tell you in no uncertain terms that the situation is a crisis. But unlike the nation's most visible water crisis in Flint, Mich. -- where 98,000 people were drinking water tainted with high lead levels for two years before the full story came to light -- California's drinking water problems do not exist in one central location or involve one culprit contaminant. The state's problem didn't begin on a particular date and even the number of people feeling the impact changes over time.
If you look at a website the SWRCB launched this year called the Human Right to Water Portal, which tracks the 300 or so chronic offenders, you can see California's problems are literally all over the map, stretching nearly 1,000 miles from Calexico on the Mexico border to Crescent City in the north of the state. Unlike an earthquake or flood, the drinking water catastrophe did not strike suddenly but has been a slow-motion disaster unfolding over decades.
In some cases the water quality problems stem from agricultural pesticides no longer in use but still found in groundwater, such as 1,2-Dibromo-3-Chloropropane, classified as a probable carcinogen. In other cases they are the result of slowly accumulating levels of naturally occurring elements such as arsenic, which over time can cause blindness, paralysis and, potentially, cancer at high levels of exposure. Or they result from the gradual breakdown of infrastructure - leaking pipes, collapsing wells.
The problems are heavily concentrated in low-income communities of color, especially in the San Joaquin Valley, the southern half of California's 450 mile-long Central Valley and the epicenter of the state's $47 billion-a-year agricultural industry. There and in the Salinas Valley, nitrate is one of the biggest water contaminants; it infiltrates into groundwater when nitrogen is applied to cropland either through fertilizers or animal waste, according to a report from the University of California, Davis.
Other agriculture-intensive areas are hard hit, too, like the eastern Coachella Valley in Riverside County, where water systems serving a concentration of small mobile home parks housing farmworker families lack the infrastructure to treat arsenic and bacterial contaminants in their water.
There are some areas that you might not expect to see on the map, too - water systems in the wealthy Silicon Valley enclave of Palo Alto made the list, as did the wine-growing capital of Napa. The water systems had problems with disinfectant byproducts - chemicals formed when chlorine used to treat water reacts with organic matter. Two kinds of disinfectant byproducts occur most frequently in California - trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, which the state says have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals and ""may produce similar effects in people.""
For all the diversity of problems and locations, there is one common denominator: These repeat violations are most prevalent in small water systems.
The vast majority of Californians, more than 35 million people, get their water from one of about 400 urban water systems that serve populations of at least 10,000 people. And the vast majority of Californians drink clean, safe water.
But close to a half a million people get their water from one of about 600 water systems, which serve just 300 to 1,500 people each. A further 166,000 people are connected to nearly 1,000 water systems serving just 75 to 300 people each. It's these smaller systems that are most problematic.
""Small community water systems typically lack the infrastructure and economies of scale of larger water systems, and in some cases cannot afford to treat or find alternative supplies for a contaminated drinking water source,"" an SWRCB report found. ""As a result, small community water systems may be more vulnerable to serving contaminated groundwater to their customers than larger water systems.""
Treating water to eliminate contaminants can be beyond the financial means of small systems, especially when health standards change. For instance, since the federal government in 2001 changed the maximum limit for arsenic from 50 parts per billion to 10 parts per billion, small water systems have struggled to comply with the new standard, which requires expensive treatment.
""And some of these same small systems will be hit with another regulation for 1,2,3-trichloropropane (1,2,3-TCP) later this year,"" says Souza, noting that the state is preparing to set a health standard for a contaminant it identified as carcinogenic in 1992. The contaminant was found in industrial solvents and two now-defunct fumigants that were used by Central Valley farmers.
""This is not just an issue of science and engineering, it's an issue of adequate resources and leadership capacity,"" says Susana De Anda, the co-founder and co-executive director of the Community Water Center, which advocates in California for clean drinking water as a human right.
Life at the margins
""This is Third World living standards - this is California, this is the United States,"" says Becky Quintana, describing life in her hometown of Seville, a small rural community of fewer than 500 residents in eastern Tulare County in the hulking shadow of the Sierra Nevada mountains, just 30 miles from the entrance to Sequoia National Park.
Seville has a gas station with a convenience store, an elementary school and a water well. From Quintana's home you can see the community's well - a large metal tank and some pumps - cordoned off by a chain-link fence. Behind that runs an irrigation ditch filled with murky water and some trash, and running through the middle of the ditch is Seville's water pipeline, one that is prone to leaks. Bacterial problems from dilapidated infrastructure have plagued the community for years, says Quintana. Notices advising boiling water are common, as are taps running dry intermittently during summer months and, since 2008, unsafe levels of nitrate.
Problems in tiny Seville were so bad that in 2011 it was one of only a handful of places in the United States visited by Catarina de Albuquerque, an independent expert appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council, who was investigating unsafe drinking water and sanitation conditions.
As bad as things are in Seville, the situation is more the norm than the exception. There are 310,000 people living in 525 low-income, unincorporated communities in the San Joaquin Valley where water quality problems are common. Being unincorporated means the communities lack a municipal government and often other basic services like streetlights, paved roads, emergency services and clean drinking water.
Many of the hardest-hit communities are in areas of persistent poverty, where generations of residents haven't been able to get a leg up. A Congressional Research Service report in 2005 found residents in the San Joaquin Valley were poorer than those in central Appalachia.
Sixty-five percent of the population of these unincorporated communities are people of color and 64 percent are low-income, according to a 2013 report from the nonprofit PolicyLink.
Some of these unincorporated communities, called ""island"" or ""fringe"" communities, are near cities, even surrounded by them, but they have not been annexed into the cities' borders and lack the services that urban areas provide. Others are considered ""legacy"" communities, which are in more remote areas, typically where people moved to be close to farm field jobs. Some of these communities even began as labor camps for farm workers, such as Rich Grove, Woodville and Farmersville, says Tom Collishaw, chief executive of the nonprofit Self-Help Enterprises, which has spent more than 40 years aiding rural residents in the valley.
Over the last century the communities have been built and shaped by a changing cast of arrivals, beginning with Dust Bowl migrants from places like Oklahoma, and African-American farmers from the South. Later arrivals included seasonal farmworkers from Mexico, Japanese Americans released from World War II internment camps and, more recently, refugees from Laos and elsewhere.
African-American communities such as Home Garden and Teviston ""were places that were formed because people were not welcomed [in other communities] so they lived outside and became unincorporated communities,"" says Collishaw. ""The communities have changed over time, now they may be all Mexican-Americans, but the valley is speckled with those kinds of communities.""
An article in the California Law Review of 2012 by Camille Pannu, now director of the Water Justice Clinic at the University of California, Davis School of Law, sums up the situation: ""The exclusion of communities of color and low-income white communities from the valley's cities was not incidental - it was often an intentional policy choice, reinforced through de jure and de facto race- and class-based segregation.""
As evidence of this in practice, De Anda points to the Tulare County General Plan from the early 1970s, which called out 15 communities - 13 of which are still around - as having ""little or no authentic future"" and cited an explicit policy to essentially force them out of existence. ""These non-viable communities would, as a consequence of withholding major public facilities such as sewer and water systems, enter a process of long-term, natural decline as residents depart for improved opportunities in nearby communities,"" the plan reads.
Seville, Quintana's hometown, was among those listed. ""That's an intentional discriminatory policy written in the books and, frankly, implemented,"" says De Anda. ""That's a cheat sheet for me as an organizer to go door-knocking and tell them, 'It's not a coincidence that you don't have safe drinking water in your community.'""
Clean water on the way
On a June day, you can see the still snow-capped peaks of the Sierra Nevada from the front yard of Quintana's family home, a reminder of why irrigation ditches are running full as they pass through Seville.
Decades ago, California managed to engineer a highly complex system of water conveyance to funnel snowmelt hundreds of miles through canals, reservoirs and pumps to transform arid land into one of the world's most productive farming regions. But it's a water system designed to feed the farms of the valley and the cities of southern California, not the region's rural communities. The water runs right by them.
In Tulare County, 40 of 41 community systems are reliant on contaminated groundwater as their sole source of drinking water. When small systems cannot meet health standards because they lack funds to treat contaminated water, residents are forced to either take a risk and drink water from the tap or spend twice for water - once for dirty water they can't drink and once for bottled water.
Lucy Hernandez lives in West Goshen in Tulare County, a community where the water is contaminated by high levels of nitrate. ""We're to the point where we tell our kids not to drink too much water,"" she says. ""We either buy shoes for kids or water bottles. It shouldn't get to that point. If we had safe drinking water that's money we'd use for our families."" Hernandez says she has been spending $60 to $70 a month on bottled water for her family of seven, in addition to the regular water utility bill.
Goshen was recently able to connect to nearby Visalia's water system. In Seville, Quintana sees a light at the end of the tunnel as a nearly decade-long battle to hook Seville up to neighboring Yettem's water system is expected to be completed this year. But almost 10 years without safe water is too long, she says.
""We've always had these problems. We always addressed our [county] board of supervisors, but we were just people from a little community and we were really ignored for a lot of years. But the more people you get involved, other communities, you have a bigger voice and people do listen.""
In tiny Tombstone Territory, Carolina Garcia dreams of connecting her home's water to the town of Sanger next door. And she wants her rural community to have access to the same services that cities enjoy.
""If we were connected with Sanger we wouldn't have so many obstacles against us, we wouldn't have to struggle to get these resources,"" she says. ""I just want people to know our needs out here and the services that we are lacking. We are out here in a rural area and hope they don't forget about us.""
Thanks in part to the drought, the willingness of local residents to organize and the advocacy of nonprofit groups, the San Joaquin Valley's drinking water problems are no longer a secret. And there is movement in Sacramento from legislators and regulators to fund solutions. But cleaning up chronically contaminated water in 300 communities will take time and money. A lot of money.
Drinking water advocates are pushing for a new bill to provide several hundred million dollars annually to address ongoing operations and maintenance issues for water systems, but Jonathan Nelson of the Community Water Center says upward of $1 billion could also be required upfront for capital investments.
At least, now, more people who live in the communities are helping to shape the conversation of what those solutions look like.
""It's important to recognize that just because you are low-income, or a person of color, or speak Spanish, you shouldn't have to live in this reality,"" says De Anda. ""The current condition in California is a systemic problem and we need to address it from the root.""

94,California to vote on regulating toxic chemicals in water,,2017-07-18,"California to vote on regulating toxic chemicals in water By Allen Cone | July 18, 2017 at 3:02 PM Comments 
July 18 (UPI) -- California officials are poised Tuesday to regulate a substance in water that experts say is a powerful cancer-causing agent in water worldwide. 
The substance -- called 1,2,3 trichloropropane, or TCP -- is prevalent in the Central Valley of California as a degreasing agent used in the production of plastic products. 
The majority of residents in the San Joaquin Valley rely on groundwater as their drinking water. In 2016, 63 percent of California public water systems that detected nitrates, including TCP, were in the Valley, according to the State Water Resources Control Board. 
The Environmental Working Group , an advocacy organization, released a report in April that found 94 water systems serving eight million Californians are contaminated with 1,2,3-trichloropropane. 
It then updated its report to say additional analysis found the substance as a contaminant in the drinking water of at least 17 states. It plans to issue more details on the nationwide tests. 
Residents of the Central California farming communities are blaming their sickness on the TCP. 
""The word that really captures all of it is 'outrage,'"" said Jerry Tinoco, 45, a resident of the city of Arvin who told NBC News and at least three close family members have been diagnosed with cancer. ""It's a man-made chemical, so someone is to blame."" 
No research shows the chemical has caused cancer spikes in specific communities, but some residents and experts told NBC News that research has yet to be done in towns like Arvin. 
But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has concluded it's ""likely to be carcinogenic to humans."" The California Water Board warns residents not to shower with tainted water because they might inhale the chemical. 
The Water Board plans to set a legally permitted limit -- a Maximum Contaminant Level, or MCL -- requiring public utilities to test their water and, if needed, install filters to lower the level of the chemical. 
So far, Hawaii is the only state with a legal limit -- 600 parts per trillion. 
""If you drink water over a lifetime that contains 1,2,3-TCP at concentrations higher than the PHG, there is an increased lifetime risk of developing cancer,"" the Water Board said on its websitre. ""The increased risk depends on 1,2,3-TCP concentration in the water. For water with a 1,2,3-TCP concentration of 5 ppt, the increased lifetime cancer risk is less than one cancer case per 100,000 people. For water with a 1,2,3-TCP concentration of 70 ppt, the increased lifetime cancer risk is about one in 10,000 people. 
Paul Tratnyek, a professor at the Institute of Environmental Health at Oregon Health and Science University has studied TCP for the Defense Department. 
""Even the slightest amount of TCP in the water would be considered to be a potential health effect,"" Tratnyek said. 
In Arvin, the city tested the water for TCP. A state-certified lab found more than six times the amount the state says is acceptable. 
In California's Central Valley, the high TCP levels are attributed to two industrial giants that recycled TCP by packaging it with agricultural pesticides. 
""TCP got into drinking water in the Central Valley because Dow Chemical Company and Shell Oil Company saw an opportunity decades ago to take a hazardous waste stream at their chemical plants, put it in barrels and sell it to farmers, who would then inject it into the ground,"" said lawyer Toss Robbins, who represents 30 communities that are suing Dow and Shell to get them to pay for the multi-million dollar filtration process required to clean water supplies. 
In 2010, the companies prevailed in a 2010 lawsuit filed by the city of Redlands. But the companies have settled other suits. In a Central Valley city two hours north of Arvin, a jury awarded Clovis $22 million to treat contaminated water and remove TCP from its wells. 
In a statement, Shell said that the product has been out of use for years, it contained only ""trace amounts"" of TCP and that it was approved by the federal and California governments. Related UPI Stories",['Arvin'],upi.com
95,Watch: San Joaquin Valley residents grapple with unsafe water,upi.com,2017-07-08,"July 8 (UPI) -- Carolina Garcia found out three months ago that her family's well had unsafe levels of nitrate and bacteria. She and her family of six live in a small neighborhood in Fresno County, in California's San Joaquin, and they now use as much of their limited income as they can to buy bottled water.
And it's not just private wells that are problematic. There are 300 community water systems in the state that face chronic water quality issues, according to the State Water Resources Control Board.
Becky Quintana lives in one of those communities - Seville, in Tulare County - where residents have been waiting nine years for safe drinking water.

96,Strategies to Improve Private-Well Water Quality: A North Carolina Perspective,Daniil Lyalko,2017-07-08,"Supplemental Material Background: Evidence suggests that the 44.5 million U.S. residents drawing their drinking water from private wells face higher risks of waterborne contaminant exposure than those served by regulated community water supplies. Among U.S. states, North Carolina (N.C.) has the second-largest population relying on private wells, making it a useful microcosm to study challenges to maintaining private-well water quality. Objectives: This paper summarizes recommendations from a two-day summit to identify options to improve drinking-water quality for N.C. residents served by private wells. Methods: The Research Triangle Environmental Health Collaborative invited 111 participants with knowledge of private-well water challenges to attend the Summit. Participants worked in small groups that focused on specific aspects and reconvened in plenary sessions to formulate consensus recommendations. Discussion: Summit participants highlighted four main barriers to ensuring safe water for residents currently relying on private wells: (1) a database of private well locations is unavailable; (2) racial disparities have perpetuated reliance on private wells in some urbanized areas; (3) many private-well users lack information or resources to monitor and maintain their wells; and (4) private-well support programs are fragmented and lack sufficient resources. The Summit produced 10 consensus recommendations for ways to overcome these barriers. Conclusions: The Summit recommendations, if undertaken, could improve the health of North Carolinians facing elevated risks of exposure to waterborne contaminants because of their reliance on inadequately monitored and maintained private wells. Because many of the challenges in N.C. are common nationwide, these recommendations could serve as models for other states. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP890

The introduction of municipal water-treatment systems was one of the greatest public health advances in the U.S. during the twentieth century. A 2005 study of historical public health data in 13 major U.S. cities attributed nearly half of overall mortality reduction, two-thirds of child mortality reduction, and three-quarters of infant mortality reduction between 1900 and 1936 to the installation of municipal water chlorination and filtration systems ( Cutler and Miller 2005 ). The same study estimated that the public health benefits of these investments exceeded total construction, operation, and maintenance costs by a factor of 23 over that period. 
Today, communities served by municipal water systems are protected by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974 and its subsequent amendments ( Tiemann 2014 ). Under the SDWA, public water systems must ensure that the water they deliver meets health-based water-quality requirements, known as maximum contaminant levels (MCLs), for 91 contaminants. To ensure compliance, utilities must monitor water quality on a monthly or more frequent basis, depending on the size of the system. When monitoring detects contaminants at concentrations exceeding one or more MCLs, the water utility must notify its consumers and take corrective action, such as upgrading its treatment processes. The SDWA provides funds that states can use to assist public water systems with the costs of improvements, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) offers technical assistance to plan such improvements. 
Although most U.S. residents benefit from municipally treated water regulated by the SDWA, the 14% of the population (44.5 million people) who obtain their drinking water from private wells are excluded from these protections ( Maupin et al. 2014 ). An analysis of waterborne disease outbreak data from 1971 to 2006 showed that although outbreaks associated with public water supplies decreased during that period, the number of outbreaks from private well contamination increased ( Craun et al. 2010 ). Evidence suggests that although many private wells deliver water of high quality, a substantial fraction may be contaminated. Past state-level surveys report that 40–58% of private wells exceed at least one SDWA health-based standard, most commonly for bacterial contamination ( Swistock et al. 2012 ; Knobeloch et al. 2013 ; Pieper et al. 2015 ). Concerns about children’s exposures led the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2009 to issue a policy statement recommending that pediatricians ask families if they obtain their water from private wells to determine whether water contamination could be a source of illnesses (such as gastrointestinal illness and lead poisoning) ( American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Environmental Health and Committee on Infectious Diseases, 2009 ). The policy statement encourages pediatricians to recommend that parents test and maintain their wells at least annually for coliform bacteria and nitrates along with lead if a child has an elevated blood lead level. 
Among U.S. states, North Carolina (N.C.) has the second-highest total population (3.3 million) after Pennsylvania ( Figure 1 ) and the third-highest population percentage (35%, after Maine and Alaska) of residents relying on private wells for drinking water ( Maupin et al. 2014 ). Although this distinction in part reflects that N.C. has the second-largest rural population in the nation (3.2 million), 939,000 private well users (28.4% of the total) are in the six counties classified as urban by the N.C. Rural Economic Development Center due to their high population densities (above 750 people per square mile) ( U.S. Geological Survey 2016 ; The Rural Center 2016 ). Recent research has revealed associations between N.C. private-well water quality and health risks. For example, our recent research demonstrated that 99% of N.C. emergency-department hospital visits for acute gastrointestinal illness associated with exposure to waterborne microbial contaminants are attributable to private-well contamination ( DeFelice et al. 2016 ). Other recent research has linked elevated concentrations of metals in N.C. private wells to the risk of birth defects ( Sanders et al. 2014 ). With such high incidence of reliance on private wells and with recent evidence of significant health risks for some private-well users, N.C. offers a useful microcosm in which to analyze challenges and solutions to ensuring that private wells deliver safe drinking water. Figure 1. Among U.S. states, North Carolina has the second-largest number of people relying on private wells for their drinking water. Data source: Maupin et al. 2014 . 
Recognizing the need for new solutions to N.C.’s private-well water quality challenges and the potential broader national relevance of these challenges, the N.C. Research Triangle Environmental Health Collaborative (Collaborative) convened a summit, “Safe Water from Every Tap,” on 26–27 October 2015, to identify and discuss strategies to reduce health risks from private-well water contamination. This paper provides context to understand obstacles to maintaining private-well water quality in N.C. and summarizes major recommendations from the Summit. Although the Summit focused on N.C., many challenges to private-well stewardship are common nationwide. In the discussion, we highlight the broader relevance of the Summit recommendations to other states. Methods 
The Summit was organized by the Collaborative’s 14-member executive committee, which is chaired by former N.C. Public Health Director Leah Devlin and Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) Secretary William Ross (Table S1). To represent a variety of perspectives, the committee invited representatives of county, state, and federal agencies, public health practitioners, academic scientists, nonprofit community-based organizations, elected officials and policy makers, industry and water utility representatives, and environmental and public health consultants with knowledge of private-well water quality challenges. In all, 111 participants attended (Figure S1; Table S2). Several participants (e.g., from the Southeast Rural Community Assistance Project and community-based organizations) represented constituencies of private-well owners. In addition, other attendees served a dual role representing their organization (such as the N.C. Division of Public Health) and as a current or former private-well owner. 
To facilitate interactive discussions and cross-disciplinary exchanges, the Summit alternated between expert plenaries and small work-group breakout sessions. Participants registered for one of four work groups on the themes of (1) private-well owner education, (2) governance and policy for private wells, (3) groundwater pollution prevention, and (4) user-friendly technology for private-well monitoring and maintenance. Participants remained in the same group throughout multiple breakout sessions to facilitate the development of within-group recommendations. 
The plenary on the Summit’s first day featured presentations on federal and state programs related to private-well water quality and a panel discussion including communities affected by private-well contamination. During the afternoon, work groups met separately to define private-well water quality challenges related to their group’s theme. All participants then reconvened to discuss and debate challenges highlighted by each group and to identify common themes. The second day followed a similar structure, with a morning plenary presenting innovative technologies for managing decentralized water supplies, followed by work-group breakout sessions to identify and prioritize solutions to the challenges identified on the first day. During the last plenary, participants integrated and prioritized common themes and recommendations from the four groups. The executive committee further refined recommendations through e-mail feedback after the Summit. Results 
Participants in the “Safe Water from Every Tap” Summit engaged in a consensus process to identify challenges to and recommendations to improve N.C. private-well water quality. Participants decided to focus their recommendations on four critical challenges: The N.C. population relying on private wells is poorly characterized. Consequently, the N.C. Division of Public Health and county health departments lack the information they need to target households for risk communication, technical assistance, or other interventions. Racial discrimination in the establishment of municipal boundaries excluded some peri-urban N.C. communities from public water service. As a result, these communities rely on private wells despite their proximity to municipal water lines and are at risk of exposure to well-water contaminants brought about by high population densities. Many N.C. private-well users lack the knowledge and/or resources needed to routinely monitor and maintain their well water. These well users are therefore at risk of exposure to contamination that could be detected and removed if the households were part of a well-managed and regulated community water system or if household treatment were installed and properly maintained by the user. Programs to protect private-well water quality and to support homeowners in managing their wells are fragmented across state and county agencies. These programs lack the resources to help private-well owners ensure that their drinking water meets recommended health-based standards, such as the standards that community water supplies are required to meet under the U.S. SWDA. 
Participants proposed 10 high-priority recommendations to address these challenges. Table 1 summarizes the recommendations and proposes a time sequence for implementation. The following sections provide context to understand the need for these recommendations. Table 1. Ten recommendations for protecting the health of households relying on private wells. Recommendation Timing Challenge 1: Private Well Population Is Poorly Characterized  1.

NC General Assembly Immediate Challenge 1: Private-Well Population is Poorly Characterized 
Ideally, county health departments would send regular communications to private-well owners reminding them to test their wells each year and providing information about what to do if tests revealed water-quality problems. However, neither the individual counties nor the state has a complete database with addresses of private-well owners. As a result, delivering these messages or other interventions to help well owners poses a major challenge. 
The most comprehensive nationwide private-well population inventory (the basis for Figure 1 ) was compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) ( Maupin et al. 2014 ). Although the USGS data are useful in identifying counties with high incidence of reliance on private wells, these data lack geographic locations of private wells. The USGS data were developed by obtaining data regarding the size of the population served by each public water-supply system in each county and then subtracting the total from the county population. 
Several other data sources could help to identify private-well locations. Potential sources include utility service area maps, water pipeline maps, N.C. private-well permitting and testing databases, and the U.S. Census. However, our investigations have shown that none of these sources provides complete and accurate spatial coverage ( Leker 2015 ). GIS files containing utility service-area boundaries are often overly inclusive, for example, showing the entire county as being included in the water utility’s service area even in counties where a large population relies on private wells. Detailed water-utility maps that show water-main locations have been difficult to obtain due to post-9/11 security concerns. To our knowledge, the most recent map of water-main locations, compiled by the N.C. Rural Economic Development Center, includes only 75 of the state’s 100 counties and has not been updated since 1997 ( Leker 2015 ). Even when utility pipeline maps are publicly available, they indicate water-main locations but not addresses of households served. We are aware of neighborhoods that are bisected by water-service lines but that contain households unconnected to those lines ( Heaney et al. 2013 ; MacDonald Gibson et al. 2014 ). 
Statewide well permitting and testing databases are another potential source of private-well-owner addresses. Since 1967, N.C. has required permits for all new drinking-water wells. However, rather than being issued and tracked by the state, permits are issued and filed by counties in paper copies. Some counties (for example, Chatham http://www.chathamnc.org/index.aspx?page=1887 ) have digitally scanned some of its permits and are beginning to construct databases, but a complete, statewide inventory is unavailable. Furthermore, wells constructed before 1967 are exempt. Since 1 January 2009, N.C. has required that all new wells must be tested for selected contaminants; county health departments collect water samples and send them to the N.C. State Laboratory of Public Health. The locations of tested wells could be used to map locations of households that rely on private wells, but only for wells constructed since 2009. In addition, because test results are typically submitted as paper copies, adequate resources would need to be provided to the N.C. State Laboratory of Public Health to convert all of the paper forms to a searchable database. 
A final potential information source on N.C. private well locations is the U.S. Census. Through 1990, the Census collected household-level data on drinking-water sources. However, this question was classified as nonmandatory after 1990 as part of a process of streamlining the Census questionnaire ( U.S. Census Bureau 2009 ). The streamlined 2000 Census, unlike its 1990 predecessor, excluded all questions that were not required by federal law. Local, county, or state governments can request that the U.S. Census Bureau conduct a special census that could include questions about water and sewer access ( U.S. Census Bureau 2015 ). However, the requesting governments must pay for this service, and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget must approve the questions. 
In summary, the Summit participants identified lack of address-level and demographic data on N.C. households relying on private wells as a critical barrier to developing outreach to residents and other programs to ensure adequate water quality. To address this barrier, participants recommended the following: Summit recommendation 1. 
The N.C. Division of Public Health (DPH) or DEQ should collect and coordinate all available state and county data relevant to characterizing the locations of private wells. Data sources may include well-construction and well-abandonment forms, N.C. State Laboratory of Public Health well-sampling records, and municipal water-pipe maps. Gaps in the inventory should be identified, and a program initiated (possibly including door-to-door efforts in targeted communities) to fill the gaps. Although this effort should be coordinated with local health departments, these departments are insufficiently resourced to bear the burden of data collection; therefore, state funding and coordination are essential to success. If completed, such a database could serve as a model for other states that also lack comprehensive, centralized data on private-well locations and characteristics. Challenge 2: Racial Disparities Have Perpetuated Reliance on Private Wells in Some Communities 
Some peri-urban neighborhoods in N.C. are excluded from nearby water service despite their proximity to municipal water lines. Due to high population and septic-system densities, wells in such neighborhoods may be at increased risk of contamination ( Borchardt et al. 2003 ; Stillo and MacDonald Gibson 2017 ). 
Several N.C. case studies have documented African American communities on the borders of or surrounded by towns and cities that are excluded from nearby municipal services. For example, a 2004 case study documented that the Mebane City Council over its history had systematically drawn discontiguous municipal boundaries in order to exclude four black communities ( Johnson et al. 2004 ). Although one of the communities neighbored the municipal sewage-treatment plant, neither this community nor the other three had access to municipal water or sewer service. Exclusionary zoning practices continued in Mebane through at least the 1990s as the town annexed satellite parcels slated for high-income residential development and continued to exclude the historically black communities. In 2005, the New York Times reported on a similar predicament affecting African American communities around Pinehurst, site of the U.S. Open Golf Tournament that year ( Dewan 2005 ). In 2013, Heaney et al. documented exclusion from municipal services in the Rogers Road community neighboring Chapel Hill and Carrboro ( Heaney et al. 2013 ). In 2014, researchers found statistical evidence of racial exclusion from water service in extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) areas of Wake County ( MacDonald Gibson et al. 2014 ). These ETJ areas border or are surrounded by municipalities, and the municipalities are allowed to control zoning decisions there, but they are not required to provide municipal services (although they may elect to do so). We found that in Wake County ETJ census blocks, every 10% increase in the black population proportion increased the odds of exclusion from municipal water service by 3.8% ( MacDonald Gibson et al. 2014 ). In addition, we found a high prevalence of bacterial contaminants (29% of samples tested positive for total coliform bacteria and 6.4% were positive for Escherichia coli ) in household drinking water in these excluded communities, and showed an increased risk of visiting an emergency department for acute gastrointestinal illness ( Stillo and MacDonald Gibson 2017 ). 
Summit participants agreed that improving drinking-water quality in peri-urban households still relying on private wells should be a high priority due to their proximity to regulated municipal water supplies and the increased risks to water quality from the relatively high population densities. Our prior research interviewing 25 key informants and 18 private-well owners in ETJ areas in four N.C. counties (Wake, New Hanover, Hoke, and Transylvania) explored the major barriers to connecting to municipal services ( Naman and MacDonald Gibson 2015 ; Fizer 2016 ). Cost was the most prominent concern for officials, who would need to authorize service extensions, and for well owners. For example, a town mayor told us, “We’ve got a section in town here that does want to be annexed. The [city] will not do it. We did a study on it… . The payback was like 115 years” ( Naman and MacDonald Gibson 2015 ). Homeowners doubted their ability to pay for connections to municipal water systems and to afford monthly water bills. For example, one private-well owner said, “But I know I am going to have to [deal with well water the rest of my life] because I cannot afford to have the city tapped in … . It is like five houses on this street that we all have well water and we would like to have city water” ( Fizer 2016 ). Some homeowners also communicated that they preferred their well water because of its flavor and odor, even in households where we detected bacterial contaminants ( Fizer 2016 ; Stillo and MacDonald Gibson 2017 ). In other communities, homeowners may desire access to municipal supplies but fear advocating for such services due to fear that public health officials could condemn their land if their septic system is failing ( Naman and MacDonald Gibson 2015 ). Some communities (such as in Mebane) have advocated for municipal service extensions for decades, but their requests have been continually denied or only partially fulfilled ( Johnson et al. 2004 ; Wilson et al. 2008 ). 
As a start toward improving the safety of drinking water in peri-urban areas historically excluded from nearby municipal water service, Summit participants recommended that the state undertake two studies: Summit recommendation 2.1. 
The N.C. General Assembly should authorize and fund a study to identify ETJ areas underserved by community water and sewer service that could be connected to existing municipal water lines. The study should evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of extending community water services and should consider other potential mechanisms (for example, designating a responsible environmental or public health management entity) to ensure drinking water quality. Summit recommendation 2.2. 
A preliminary statewide analysis of the capital costs of water-service extensions to underserved ETJ communities should be completed, and areas in need of service extension should be prioritized. Existing and potential innovative options for financing capital costs of service extensions should be identified. This analysis should also examine the feasibility of establishing third-party options to administer the funds and mechanisms to help low-income communities afford monthly water and sewer bills. In addition, this effort should evaluate the legislative changes to annexation necessary for municipalities to extend services and to assess secondary impacts of infrastructure extension (e.g., changes in impervious surfaces, economic development, and public health). Challenge 3: Many Private Well Users Lack Knowledge and Resources to Test and Maintain Their Wells 
Statewide private-well testing data indicate that few N.C. well owners monitor their water quality on a routine basis. Although N.C. has required testing of new wells since January 1, 2009, the number of wells tested illustrate this program’s limited reach. Over the five-year period 1 January 2009–31 December 2013, the N.C. State Center for Health Statistics reported that 16,138 well-water samples statewide had been tested. Assuming each sample represents a distinct well, only 1.2% of all 1.3 million self-supplied domestic water wells were tested. Our interviews with 18 private-well owners in Wake County found that one (5.5%) tested at the recommended annual frequency, another two (11%) tested every 2–3 y, two (11%) tested every 4–5 y, and the rest (72%) tested less than every 5 y or not at all ( Fizer 2016 ). Among this group, only eight (44%) reported ever taking any action to maintain their wells. All 18 interviewees thought they could detect contaminants through taste, odor, and appearance. All also mentioned costs as a barrier to testing. In Wake County, bacteriological analysis costs $25 per sample, $20–105 per sample with additional sample collection fees of $50 for some contaminants. 
Even if well owners do monitor their water quality, the costs of home-treatment systems may pose a barrier to taking action when contaminants are detected. Purchase and installation of a whole-house water filter to remove contaminants typically costs hundreds to thousands of dollars, depending on the type of unit. Point-of-use treatment devices, which treat water for only a single tap, are less costly (with purchase costs as low as $25), but they do not provide complete coverage of all faucets. Some Wake County well owners we interviewed mentioned cost as a barrier to the purchase of a treatment system ( Fizer 2016 ). One homeowner reported that her water had been tested and contaminants found, but that she could not afford a treatment unit, so she stopped drinking the water and only uses it for nonpotable purposes. 
To promote monitoring and maintenance of private wells, Summit participants recommended the following new initiatives: Summit recommendation 3.1. 
The DPH should develop marketing campaigns to promote private well testing and maintenance. Social marketing campaigns could target new parents (for example, through prenatal classes and medical practices); child care centers; K–12 schools; recipients of Women, Infants, and Children program benefits; health care providers; mobile health clinics; Medicare recipients; and faith-based groups and homes in areas known to be at risk of contamination (especially those with wells pre-dating mandatory new-well testing). The campaigns could include distribution of drinking-water test kits with instructions about where to send the kits for analysis and links to a website to help homeowners interpret test results (see recommendation 3.5). The campaigns also could include information about contamination prevention, such as proper septic-system maintenance. Summit recommendation 3.2. 
A state agency or foundation should fund a study to analyze options for providing financial assistance to low-income private well users to afford the costs of private-well monitoring and maintenance. Existing programs, supported by federal and state governments and private organizations, that help low-income households pay their energy bills could serve as models for similar programs for private-well owners. For example, the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services operates a federally funded Low-Income Energy Assistance Program to provide one-time payments for households unable to pay their winter heating or summer cooling bills ( North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services 2016 ); many counties and energy utilities offer similar programs ( Duke Energy, 2017 ). Summit recommendation 3.3. 
DPH, DEQ, or a private foundation should support a study of options for promoting the development of affordable private-well contract maintenance services, in which private-system users pay subscription fees for routine well maintenance and testing and for assistance in installing and maintaining household water-treatment systems where contamination is identified. These services could also include septic-system maintenance in areas where septic systems threaten private-well water quality. Summit recommendation 3.4. 
The N.C. General Assembly should allocate resources to the DEQ to build an interactive mapping tool for use by well owners and county health departments in identifying wells at risk of contamination. Such a tool could be modeled after the U.S. EPA’s Drinking Water Mapping Application for Protecting Source Waters. Other state agencies should be required to contribute relevant data. Adequate resources should be provided to enable the DEQ to fill gaps in data necessary to delineate areas where private wells are at highest risk of contamination and to monitor contaminant trends. Summit recommendation 3.5. 
The DPH should update and upgrade its existing websites to assist homeowners in finding state-accredited water testing labs, selecting contaminants for monitoring, collecting samples, interpreting test results, and selecting water-treatment technologies. The website should be linked to the interactive mapping tool to be developed by the DEQ. It should include a comprehensive catalog of currently available, easily used point-of-use and whole-house treatment technologies and an interactive decision tool to help homeowners select an appropriate technology. The website could be modeled on New Hampshire’s Be Well Informed and Pennsylvania’s Drinking Water Interpretation Tool. One feature of these sites is that they enable users to enter their measured water-quality parameters. The sites then generate a customized interpretation, including information about whether the parameters were above or below the SDWA MCLs and links to more information. The New Hampshire tool also provides information about possible treatment options and discusses the adverse health effects of each parameter. Summit recommendation 3.6. 
The DPH or DEQ should create a statewide network of professionals who provide information and training on private-well issues. This network could host workshops and presentations on such issues. Professionals could be encouraged to participate by offering continuing-education credits. Use of a webinar format would facilitate communication among agencies and universities and minimize travel and financial burdens. This network could be linked to the U.S.   (CDC) and Prevention’s Private Well Community of Practice, which hosts a bimonthly webinar highlighting cutting-edge research addressing water and health problems in private wells throughout the United States. Challenge 4: Private-Well Programs are Fragmented and Insufficiently Resourced 
As previously mentioned, the SDWA does not regulate private wells. The N.C. legislature has enacted several laws governing various aspects of well construction, along with programs to protect groundwater sources tapped by private wells ( Table 2 ). In addition, county health departments provide well testing services upon request, and some offer reduced-cost testing for low-income households. However, as Table 2 illustrates, administration of these programs is fragmented across agencies. No single organization is in charge of helping private-well owners ensure the safety of their drinking water. Table 2. Existing private well protection programs in North Carolina (NC). Program Implementing agencies Permitting, inspection, and testing of new wells Since July 1, 2008, every new private drinking water well must be permitted, inspected, and tested by the local health department. Testing includes analysis for arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, fluoride, lead, iron, magnesium, manganese, mercury, nitrates, nitrites, selenium, silver, sodium, zinc, pH, and bacterial indicators. Follow-up testing after construction is not required. Local health departments, with oversight of Division of Public Health (DPH) Well construction standards Every well must be constructed to meet statewide minimum standards for location, casing, grouting, and screening. Some counties have enacted more stringent standards. Local health departments in conjunction with DPH Well contractor certification Any person engaged in well construction, installation, repair, or abandonment must be certified by the NC Well Contractor Certification Commission. Certification is based on a written exam, work experience, and field observation. NC Well Contractor Certification Commission (staffed by DPH) Voluntary well testing Local health departments offer low-cost well testing upon request. Sampling by local health departments. Analysis by the State Laboratory for Public Health, certified private lab, or local health department. Health risk evaluations DPH provides recommendations for well water use based on results of the mandatory sampling of new wells or voluntary sampling. DPH and local health departments Groundwater classifications and quality standards NC law has established drinking water as the best intended use for groundwater, and the NC Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has developed standards to protect the resource for that use. Violations trigger corrective action, with restoration to potable standards as the goal (though alternative standards are possible).

To improve coordination across state and county programs and evaluate the adequacy of existing programs, Summit participants recommended the following: Summit recommendation 4. 
The N.C. General Assembly should commission a study of the adequacy of existing private-well regulations and programs. The study should evaluate well-construction standards, consider requiring operating permits for private wells on rental properties, assess the value and feasibility of requiring well testing at the time of property resale, and evaluate the potential for support programs for low-income well owners. It should also evaluate the adequacy of DPH and DEQ staffing to track contamination and maintenance issues and provide technical assistance to well owners and local health departments. Discussion 
The 2016 NC Environmental Health Collaborative Summit highlighted four principal barriers to ensuring that N.C. residents who rely on private wells receive drinking water of sufficient quality to protect their health. These barriers are (1) lack of a comprehensive database of private-well locations, (2) exclusion of some peri-urban minority communities from municipal services, (3) lack of well owner compliance with recommendations for monitoring and maintaining their wells, and (4) a fragmented system of regulations and programs for supporting private-well owners. 
Other states face similar challenges. Elsewhere, as in N.C., databases with locations of private-well owners are incomplete. For example, in Oregon, private-well testing data are collected on paper forms that are not routinely digitized or collected by a central state agency ( Hoppe et al. 2011 ). Texas began digitizing private-well construction reports in 2003, but records of wells built before then are not included in the state’s database, although scanned, portable document files of prior hand-written well reports are available ( Texas Water Development Board 2016 ). The U.S. CDC has recognized the lack of data on private-well locations and has established a Private Well Initiative, the first goal of which is to answer the question, “Where are the unregulated drinking water systems in the U.S.?” ( Backer and Tosta 2011 ). However, to date, a national database of well locations does not exist. 
Racial disparities in access to nearby community water services also have been documented elsewhere. Aiken was the first to describe the use of selective annexation to exclude black communities from municipal boundaries and the services offered to municipal residents ( Aiken 1987 ). In a 1987 study in the Mississippi Yazoo Delta, he found that towns incorporated white neighborhoods at the urban fringe and excluded similar African-American neighborhoods to dilute the voting strength of African-American citizens. He referred to such practices as “municipal underbounding.” In a 2007 analysis of U.S. Census data from 1,992 towns and communities in eight southern states, Lichter found that towns with high white population percentages were significantly less likely to annex and provide water and other municipal services to African-American municipal fringe areas than they were to annex predominantly white fringe neighborhoods ( Lichter et al. 2007 ). Beyond the southern plantation crescent, recent research has documented racial underbounding in the Texas Lower Rio Grande Valley ( Durst 2014 ) and California’s Central Valley ( Ranganathan and Balazs 2015 ). In their article on the Central Valley, Ranganathan and Balazs referred to underbounded communities as “a piece of the Third World in the First World.” 
Lack of routine monitoring of water quality in private wells is a nationwide problem as well. For example, a 1998 survey of 244 upstate New York well owners found that 47% had never tested their water ( Schwartz et al. 1998 ). A 2009 Wisconsin survey of 2,600 well owners found that although 67% reported having ever tested their water, only 24% had done so in the past year ( Knobeloch 2009 ). A 2012 study of 622 Pennsylvania well owners found that 30% had never tested their water, and 44% had tested it just once, usually only for coliform bacteria ( Swistock et al. 2012 ). All of these studies found that well owners were largely unaware of testing recommendations ( Schwartz et al. 1998 ; Swistock et al. 2012 ). For example, in Wisconsin, 45% of 2,600 survey respondents said they did not know what to test for, and 42% said they did not know where to send samples for analysis ( Knobeloch 2009 ). Just as in N.C., the Wisconsin study revealed the misperception that drinking water contaminants can be detected through sensory perception: 82% of those who had not tested their water said their reason for not testing was that the water “tastes and looks fine.” Financial barriers are an impediment to testing elsewhere, too. The New York study found that survey respondents living in low-income/low-education counties reported lower testing prevalence (41%) than respondents living in high-income/high-education counties (64%) ( Schwartz et al. 1998 ). Similarly, the Wisconsin study reported that 33% of families earning less than $20,000 per year had ever tested their well water, and 71% of families earning more than $75,000 per year had done so ( Knobeloch 2009 ). A New Hampshire study found that among those who reported never having tested their well water for arsenic (widespread in New Hampshire’s geologic formations), 25% said cost was the major barrier to testing ( Borsuk et al. 2014 ). 
Fragmentation of programs to support private-well owners also occurs nationwide. Some states, such as Texas ( Texas Commission on Environmental Quality 2014 ) and Pennsylvania ( Swistock et al. 2012 ), do not regulate private wells at all. Among states with regulations, programs and responsible agencies vary substantially, with the latter ranging from state or local health departments to water resources agencies, natural resources departments, environmental protection agencies, and various land grant university extension services ( Rogan and Brady 2009 ). A few states have stringent testing requirements. For example, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Oregon require well-water testing at time of resale of residences ( Fox et al. 2016 ), although the testing requirements and enforcement of the laws vary substantially in these three state programs. Like N.C., many states have well-construction standards and contractor-certification or licensing requirements, but these requirements can vary substantially by state. For example, in California, local water agencies or water districts determine required minimum depths for grouting between the upper portions of the borehole and the well casing, whereas other states establish mandatory state-wide minimum depths ( California State Water Resources Control Board 2015 ). Some states require the use of pitless adapters (which allow the pipe delivering water from the well to the home to be buried below the frost line), but other states do not. 
One consequence of the lack of federal regulations and the fragmentation across state programs is that private-well owners lack access to the financial support available to regulated public water systems. The SDWA established a low-cost loan program for water utility infrastructure improvements that provided $13.1 billion in federal investments through 2009 ( Copeland and Tiemann 2010 ). Prior to the SDWA, communities with municipal systems also were eligible for grants and loans under the 1972 Clean Water Act and its predecessors through programs that Copeland and Tiemann called “the largest nonmilitary public works programs since the Interstate Highway System” ( Copeland and Tiemann 2010 ). During the Reagan Administration, the amount of federal funding for water and sewer infrastructure dropped substantially and shifted from grants to loans ( Copeland and Tiemann 2010 ). Notably, much of the period of active federal investment in clean water infrastructure coincided with the period of systematic exclusion of southern African-American communities from municipal services, denying these communities access to federal benefits afforded to similar white communities. 
Although programs to support private-well users, study the demographics of well users, and record water quality characteristics vary nationwide, prior research indicates that the challenges to private-well stewardship identified for N.C. are common nationwide. As a result, the Summit recommendations may be useful in other states that are grappling with challenges to supporting private-well owners in maintaining safe drinking water. Indeed, a report from a recent CDC workshop on private wells emphasized the need for “building an infrastructure for stewardship” of private wells nationwide ( Fox et al. 2016 ). 
One challenge not discussed by Summit participants is the effects of drought on private wells. N.C. has a relative abundance of water, with average rainfalls ranging from around 45–60 in per year, depending on region (mountain, piedmont, or coastal plain) ( National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2016 ). In contrast, rainfall in arid regions is a fraction of this amount, leaving private-well users at risk of running out of water. For example, case studies of Latino communities around Fresno, California, where average annual rainfall is 11.5 in, have reported instances of private wells running dry, forcing residents to purchase water from local grocery stores ( Pannu 2012 ). In our discussions with N.C. private-well owners, we have encountered households that were forced to haul water from grocery stores or gas stations because of well components freezing during winter. However, water quantity did not emerge as a major concern at the Summit, likely due to the general abundance of water in N.C. on average. Conclusions 
Because N.C. is an economically and racially diverse state, with land uses ranging from highly developed urban and industrial areas to rural crop and livestock production, the challenges to maintaining private-well water quality in this state are likely to reflect those in other states as well. The Collaborative Summit recommendations presented in this article should apply not only in N.C., but also in other states struggling with similar issues related to protecting the health of populations that draw their water from private wells. Indeed, N.C. could serve as a test bed for innovative private-well protection programs, such as contract maintenance, financial support, data system improvement, and outreach initiatives that could ensure private-well water quality and better health for all residents.

97,Cancer-Causing Chemical TCP Plagues California Drinking Water - NBC News,Ronan Farrow,2017-07-18,"California votes on whether to regulate toxic chemical 4:20 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=""http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/1002421315822"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
""The word that really captures all of it is 'outrage,'"" said Jerry Tinoco, 45, who is from the city of Arvin and says at least three close family members have been diagnosed with cancer. ""It's a man-made chemical, so someone is to blame."" 
There's no research showing the chemical has caused cancer spikes in specific communities, but some residents and experts told NBC News that research simply has yet to be done in towns like Arvin. 
How dangerous is TCP? The Environmental Protection Agency has concluded it's ""likely to be carcinogenic to humans,"" and the California water board warns residents not to shower with tainted water because they might inhale the chemical. 
Paul Tratnyek, a professor at the Institute of Environmental Health at Oregon Health and Science University who studied TCP for the Defense Department, said few other chemicals match its toxicity. 
""Even the slightest amount of TCP in the water would be considered to be a potential health effect,"" Tratnyek said. Paul Tratnyek, a professor at Oregon Health and Science University, studied TCP for the Pentagon and says any measurable amount is unsafe to drink. NBC News 
NBC News was in Arvin as the city tested the water for TCP. A state-certified lab found more than six times the amount the state says is acceptable. 
""Arvin is poor. But they deserve to live,"" local resident Maggie Medina said. ""They deserve clean water. They didn't create this problem."" 
TCP is a degreasing agent used in the production of plastic products. Lawyer Todd Robbins says the chemical's presence in water supplies across California's Central Valley is largely attributable to two industrial giants that recycled TCP by packaging it with agricultural pesticides. 
""TCP got into drinking water in the Central Valley because Dow Chemical Company and Shell Oil Company saw an opportunity decades ago to take a hazardous waste stream at their chemical plants, put it in barrels and sell it to farmers, who would then inject it into the ground,"" Robbins said. 
""That's how it started.""

Robbins represents 30 communities that are suing Dow and Shell to get them to pay for the multi-million dollar filtration process required to clean water supplies. Jerry Tinoco uses bottled and filtered water at his home in Arvin, California, and wonders whether TCP is to blame for family illnesses. NBC News 
The companies prevailed in a 2010 lawsuit filed by the city of Redlands, California, but they have settled other suits and recently lost their first, to a Central Valley city two hours north of Arvin. A jury awarded Clovis, California, $22 million to treat contaminated water and remove TCP from its wells. 
Among the documents Robbins has collected is an internal memo in which Dow scientists called TCP ""garbage,"" acknowledging that it had little utility in killing pests. Another memo, from Shell, raises concerns about the chemical's toxicity to animals. 
""By at least 1970, the companies knew that it posed a direct risk to groundwater, were advised by their own internal engineers and scientists to do something about it, and they failed to do so,"" he said. 
Dow and Shell declined requests for interviews, and Dow declined to comment. 
In a statement, Shell said that the product in question has been out of use for years, that it contained only ""trace amounts"" of TCP and that it was approved by the federal and California governments. The company added that the product was ""beneficial"" and that TCP was also present in other products, made by other companies. Residents of Arvin, California, worried about TCP can get filtered water at these vending machines. NBC News 
The companies also point out there have been no studies that prove TCP causes cancer in humans. 
But Jenny Rempel of the Community Water Center, an advocacy group, said animal studies are frequently used to set public health standards. In fact, that's what California relied on when it set the level at which water providers must inform residents of contamination. 
Now, the state is going beyond that, with the water board scheduled to vote on whether to would require cleanup efforts once TCP reaches a certain threshold. 
The precedent set by California on Tuesday could be important nationwide. The Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization, collected data from water utilities nationwide and concluded that TCP has been detected in at least 17 states, serving millions of people. EWG currently lists 13 on its website, but will be updating the list to include four more states . Ronan Farrow",['Arvin'],nbcnews.com
98,California’s water troubles didn’t end with the drought — they just went underground,Mark Grossi,2017-07-30,"
This story was originally published by Water Deeply . For important news about water issues and the American West, you can sign up for the Water Deeply email list . 
Evelyn Rios wept in 2014 when the well went dry at her home of 46 years — the home where she and husband Joe raised five children on farmworker wages. They cannot afford another well, so they do without. Her angst only grew as California’s five-year drought dragged on.
Finally, after one of the wettest winters on record, Governor Jerry Brown announced in April that the drought had ended. But situation remains grim, says Rios, 80, who lives in rural Madera County in California’s San Joaquin Valley. She thought she was being hooked up to the city of Madera’s water system. Now, the emergency money for such projects has dried up.
“So, the drought is over?” she asks. “What about us? What about the plans to hook up to Madera’s water? How long will we have to wait now? The drought might be over for you, but it isn’t over for me.”
Full reservoirs and swollen rivers don’t mean that much to people living in rural San Joaquin Valley, where about 1,000 people still have dry wells. Their water sits underground in the nation’s second-largest groundwater aquifer, which was mined and dramatically drawn down by farmers protecting the valley’s $40 billion-a-year agriculture industry.
Legislation passed in 2014 will help regulate groundwater pumping, but it will be at least two decades before the law is fully implemented, leaving communities vulnerable to further groundwater shortages and having to compete with big farms digging deeper wells. In addition, many of those people live in small, unincorporated communities, which often lack the resources to properly maintain community water systems.
A pistachio orchard in Tulare County, California, was planted during California’s five-year drought. A record 904 water wells were drilled in the county during 2015, in part to help sustain agricultural operations. Tara Lohan Waiting years for safe drinking water has now become a way of life in the valley. It’s one more stress for people who live in California’s most vulnerable social and environmental conditions. They face contaminated water, dirty air, lack of healthcare, and language barriers, according to a state environmental screening tool called CalEnivroScreen .
People of color in this farm country die up to 15 years sooner than people who live in more affluent areas of Fresno, according to the Central Valley Health Policy Institute at Fresno State.
Many of these rural residents will still be without reliable water this year while the rest of California debates landscape watering rules.
The state is trying not to abandon people with dry wells. Starting July 1, an additional year of free water will be delivered to massive tanks that were placed at many dwellings with dry wells, including the Rios’ home.
Which only raises more questions, say water advocates in Central California. One year won’t be enough time to fix all the problems out there. What will happen afterward? Will the state continue to buy water?
“And what will happen should any new homes run out of water during the next year?” asks Jenny Rempel, director of education and engagement for the nonprofit advocacy group Community Water Center . “There is not nearly enough funding for everyone with a dry well to get a grant or even loan assistance since the existing funding is massively oversubscribed.”
Emergency drought spending already amounts to $27 million in the Central Valley, paying for everything from a new well in East Porterville to food subsidies, says spokesman Kelly Huston of the state Office of Emergency Services. Other state agencies, such as the Department of Water Resources and the State Water Resources Control Board, will continue working to get water for residents, he says, whether there is a drought or not.
But things moved faster during the drought emergency. Advocates say the additional year of emergency water funding might elapse during the application process for state bond money, and projects might take another year to complete.
“You have to go through a longer process without the emergency,” says Maria Herrera of Visalia-based Self Help Enterprises , which has helped rural residents build and repair homes for decades. “That’s not a good solution if you’ve been waiting for years already.”
Herrera works with Tulare County residents, including those in Monson, where about 200 residents have never had access to a central water system — just private wells. Many are expected to be connected to a distribution system this year to get water from a new public well. But Monson has been waiting since 2008, when contamination was found in private wells.
“The new well is right across the street from my house,” says resident Lazara Luengas. “We might have water by the end of August. Maybe I’ll start my yard up again. It’s so hard to live without water in your home. I don’t have the words to say how grateful we are to Self Help.”
In the small, unincorporated community of Seville in the San Joaquin Valley, a new well was installed during the drought, but old infrastructure still hampers the distribution of clean water. Tara Lohan Tulare County has been at the epicenter of private dry wells, and the number of failing wells is beginning to diminish. Still, there are hundreds of problems left to resolve.
The drought crisis brought together government agencies, nonprofits, and community groups as never before, says Eric Coyne, deputy county administrator.
About 800 homes will be hooked up to water soon in East Porterville, where more than 7,000 people went dry a few years ago, Coyne says. About $40 million from state and federal sources will be spent in the process.
“I’ve never seen a project of this scale put together in the time frame that we have,” he says. “It was engineered in less than six months.”
Fixes come in all sizes and shapes. In Seville, north of Visalia, residents got a replacement for the failing and contaminated town well. But the new well delivers much higher water pressure, stressing ancient pipes — some are older than the Titanic, Coyne says. The distribution system needs to be rebuilt.
Even as millions of dollars are invested and the water comes back to many homes, residents know wells could go dry again if groundwater pumping ramps up. A Sacramento Bee investigation found a record 2,500 wells were drilled in San Joaquin Valley in 2015 during the height of the drought. The state passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act in 2014, but it won’t fully kick in until 2040.
During the drought, trillions of gallons of water were pumped without being replaced in the Central Valley, one recent study in Geophysical Research Letters shows . And farmers continue to invest in almond orchards, which cannot be fallowed during dry periods.
Vickie Ortiz, whose well is dry in Fairmead, south of Chowchilla in Madera County, says she respects her farm neighbor. But if her neighbor drills down 1,000 feet for water, it probably will eventually dry up any new, shallower well that she might get.
“We’re finding new almond plantings all around here now,” she says. “To the right of my five-acre parcel, there are 30 acres of almonds. Behind me, there’s another 20 acres. When his well goes dry, he’s going to dig deeper. Then I’ll have to dig deeper. And I’ll still have a loan on the well I’ve got. No, this is not going to end until somebody is monitoring it.”

Which only raises more questions, say water advocates in Central California. One year won’t be enough time to fix all the problems out there. What will happen afterward? Will the state continue to buy water?
“And what will happen should any new homes run out of water during the next year?” asks Jenny Rempel, director of education and engagement for the nonprofit advocacy group Community Water Center . “There is not nearly enough funding for everyone with a dry well to get a grant or even loan assistance since the existing funding is massively oversubscribed.”
Emergency drought spending already amounts to $27 million in the Central Valley, paying for everything from a new well in East Porterville to food subsidies, says spokesman Kelly Huston of the state Office of Emergency Services. Other state agencies, such as the Department of Water Resources and the State Water Resources Control Board, will continue working to get water for residents, he says, whether there is a drought or not.
But things moved faster during the drought emergency. Advocates say the additional year of emergency water funding might elapse during the application process for state bond money, and projects might take another year to complete.
“You have to go through a longer process without the emergency,” says Maria Herrera of Visalia-based Self Help Enterprises , which has helped rural residents build and repair homes for decades. “That’s not a good solution if you’ve been waiting for years already.”
Herrera works with Tulare County residents, including those in Monson, where about 200 residents have never had access to a central water system — just private wells. Many are expected to be connected to a distribution system this year to get water from a new public well. But Monson has been waiting since 2008, when contamination was found in private wells.
“The new well is right across the street from my house,” says resident Lazara Luengas. “We might have water by the end of August. Maybe I’ll start my yard up again. It’s so hard to live without water in your home. I don’t have the words to say how grateful we are to Self Help.”
In the small, unincorporated community of Seville in the San Joaquin Valley, a new well was installed during the drought, but old infrastructure still hampers the distribution of clean water. Tara Lohan Tulare County has been at the epicenter of private dry wells, and the number of failing wells is beginning to diminish. Still, there are hundreds of problems left to resolve.
The drought crisis brought together government agencies, nonprofits, and community groups as never before, says Eric Coyne, deputy county administrator.
About 800 homes will be hooked up to water soon in East Porterville, where more than 7,000 people went dry a few years ago, Coyne says. About $40 million from state and federal sources will be spent in the process.
“I’ve never seen a project of this scale put together in the time frame that we have,” he says. “It was engineered in less than six months.”
Fixes come in all sizes and shapes. In Seville, north of Visalia, residents got a replacement for the failing and contaminated town well. But the new well delivers much higher water pressure, stressing ancient pipes — some are older than the Titanic, Coyne says. The distribution system needs to be rebuilt.
Even as millions of dollars are invested and the water comes back to many homes, residents know wells could go dry again if groundwater pumping ramps up. A Sacramento Bee investigation found a record 2,500 wells were drilled in San Joaquin Valley in 2015 during the height of the drought. The state passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act in 2014, but it won’t fully kick in until 2040.
During the drought, trillions of gallons of water were pumped without being replaced in the Central Valley, one recent study in Geophysical Research Letters shows . And farmers continue to invest in almond orchards, which cannot be fallowed during dry periods.
Vickie Ortiz, whose well is dry in Fairmead, south of Chowchilla in Madera County, says she respects her farm neighbor. But if her neighbor drills down 1,000 feet for water, it probably will eventually dry up any new, shallower well that she might get.
“We’re finding new almond plantings all around here now,” she says. “To the right of my five-acre parcel, there are 30 acres of almonds. Behind me, there’s another 20 acres. When his well goes dry, he’s going to dig deeper. Then I’ll have to dig deeper. And I’ll still have a loan on the well I’ve got. No, this is not going to end until somebody is monitoring it.”

100,California Acts To Regulate Chemical That Residents Link To Spikes In Cancer,Jack Davis,2017-07-19," 
In the wake of outrage across California’s Central Valley over a chemical in tap water that some say causes cancer, California has now imposed the nation’s tightest limits on the chemical 1,2,3-trichloropropane, or TCP.
The state Tuesday approved a requirement that water utilities provide water with TCP concentrations of no higher than 5 parts per trillion. Hawaii, the only other state regulating TCP, has a limit of 600 ppt. A proposal in New Jersey would set the limit at 30 ppt.
Action came after complaints from people across the Central Valley in communities such as Arvin , where spikes in cancer rates are being blamed on the chemical

“Arvin is poor. But they deserve to live,” local resident Maggie Medina said. “They deserve clean water. They didn’t create this problem.”
Lawyer Todd Robbins believes chemical companies are to blame. TCP is a degreasing agent used in the production of plastic products.
 
“TCP got into drinking water in the Central Valley because Dow Chemical Company and Shell Oil Company saw an opportunity decades ago to take a hazardous waste stream at their chemical plants, put it in barrels and sell it to farmers, who would then inject it into the ground,” Robbins said.
Dow declined to comment.
In a statement, Shell said the product in question has been out of use for years, that it contained only “trace amounts” of TCP and that it was approved by the federal and California governments.
One researcher said it does not take much for TCP to be at an unsafe level.

“If you drink water over a lifetime that contains 1,2,3-TCP at concentrations higher than the (guideline), there is an increased lifetime risk of developing cancer,” California’s Water Board said on its website. “The increased risk depends on 1,2,3-TCP concentration in the water. For water with a 1,2,3-TCP concentration of 5 ppt, the increased lifetime cancer risk is less than one cancer case per 100,000 people. For water with a 1,2,3-TCP concentration of 70 ppt, the increased lifetime cancer risk is about one in 10,000 people.”
Juries have been split on whether chemical companies are to blame. In 2012, the companies won a suit filed by Redlands, Calif., but they recently lost a suit filed by Clovis, Calif., which required them to shell out $22 million to treat contaminated water and remove TCP from its wells.

101,‘Insidious’ Drinking Water Carcinogen Has California Water Customers Facing Rate Hikes,CBS San Francisco,2017-07-26,"‘Insidious’ Drinking Water Carcinogen Has California Water Customers Facing Rate Hikes July 25, 2017 7:24 PM Filed Under: 123-trichloropropane , Dow Chemical , Pesticide , Shell Chemical , State Water Resources Control Board , TCP 
SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) — More than one million people across 16 California counties have excessive levels of a potent carcinogen in their drinking water, and customers are now facing huge rate increases to help pay for water agencies’ compliance with newly-adopted standards. 
California isn’t the only state in the United States where groundwater is tainted with the man-made chemical 1,2,3-trichloropropane (TCP) , but California has just become the only state to adopt the toughest possible limit on the chemical in drinking water. 
Beginning January 2018, all drinking water in the state will be required to have TCP levels of no more that 5 parts per trillion (ppt). The new limit came as result of years of petitioning by environmental groups to the State Water Resources Control Board . 
At least 562 drinking wells in the state which serve nearly 100 public drinking water systems have levels of TCP above 5 ppt, according to the water board. 
The chemical has been determined in lab studies to cause cancer after long-term exposure, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
The adoption of the TCP limit may serve to strengthen the case of dozens of lawsuits filed in California on behalf of small California communities where public drinking water was polluted by the chemicals manufactured by Dow Chemical Company and Shell Chemicals, dating back to the 1940s. In the meantime, water agencies are being tasked with installing costly filtration systems which will result in rate hikes across the state. 
Public drinking water systems in at least 17 other states have also been polluted by TCP, according to Environmental Protection Agency data from 2015. 
No federal regulations of TCP yet exist, meaning that there is no requirement at the national level to filter out the chemical before it reaches residents’ taps, nor is there any requirement for public utilities to report its presence to consumers. 
The lack of federal regulation has left it up to individual states to regulate, but few states are doing so. 
California’s limit on TCP comes two and a half decades after California classified the chemical as a known carcinogen and added it to the state’s Prop. 65 list in 1992. 
Following a unanimous vote last week by the water board to set the strict new TCP limit in drinking water, Chairwoman Felicia Marcus called it “a very important day for public health.” Vice Chair Steven Moore said, given the scientific evidence of the danger of TCP, “it is disquieting how serious and insidious this chemical is.” 
TCP In The Water While many of the impacted water systems are located in the agriculturally rich San Joaquin Valley, others are in the more heavily-populated Los Angeles, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, San Diego, San Joaquin and Sacramento counties. 
Other counties with contaminated wells are Kern, Merced, Fresno, Tulare, San Bernardino, Stanislaus, Riverside, Butte, Madera, and Monterey counties. 
According to a statement this week by San Jose-based Cal Water , “TCP has been detected in some of the groundwater supplies in our Bakersfield, Visalia, Selma, Stockton, South San Francisco , and Chico service areas.” 
Cal Water spokeswoman Yvonne Kingman told CBS San Francisco that in their South San Francisco service area, TCP has been detected in four wells. 
“In 2016, the test results from these wells averaged 20 parts per trillion,” Kingman said. That’s four times the amount that will be allowed by the state under the newly adopted limit. 
Cal Water is already in the process of installing a carbon filtration system that will remove the TCP from the water in these wells and expect to be completed with the installation in the next few months, long before the compliance deadline. 
But other water utilities in the state, especially those in poorer regions, say they aren’t likely to make the compliance deadline due to the high cost of installing and maintaining a filtration system. 
Other utilities across the state say they will have to significantly increase the water bill for ratepayers if the chemical companies don’t agree to pay for the filtration systems. 
California won’t require water districts to alert residents of high levels of TCP in their water until the end of this year. In the meantime, many residents will likely continue to unknowingly drink the polluted water. 
Contamination TCP was an unnecessary impurity in the companies’ pesticides which were injected into fields until the 1980s, according to Melanie Banesh, a legislative attorney at Environmental Working Group , a D.C.-based environmental non-profit that has researched the history and potency of TCP for years. 
The pesticides, known as soil fumigants — Dow’s Telone and Shell’s D-D — were injected into agricultural fields to kill pests but the inactive ingredient in them — TCP — ended up polluting the groundwater, according to Banesh. 
Decades after its use was ended, TCP is found at high levels in groundwater in communities across the country. 
Todd Robins , a San Francisco-based attorney who has filed 32 pending lawsuits against Dow and Shell on behalf of water utilities across the state, has spent over a decade investigating TCP and working to get the companies to pay for the filtration systems in the communities impacted by the chemical. 
Robins told CBS San Francisco that Dow and Shell put TCP in their products, but failed to list it on product labels. He argues the chemical never should have been put into the pesticide mixture, could have been easily removed from drinking water years ago and is a tragic example of “big companies putting profits ahead of the environment.” 
He says it’s time for them to be held accountable. 
A 1974 letter by a Dow scientist labeled TCP as “garbage” as it served no function in killing the pest targeted by the pesticide. 
Farmers who purchased the soil fumigants were unknowingly disposing of the companies’ hazardous waste into fields across the state, according to the complaints filed against the companies. 
But a report by Shell, dating back to 1970 shows the company reviewed the environmental impact of the chemical they were manufacturing and found, “Its components are likely to be dispersed widely in the environment and whilst capable of some chemical degradation they belong in a class of compounds that are resistant to complete degradation.” 
Scientists have found that TCP can remain in groundwater for hundreds of years. 
Robins said Dow and Shell’s main argument against the lawsuits, up until now, has been that since the state had no adopted limit for TCP in its drinking water, there was no damage caused to communities. With the state’s adoption of this maximum limit last week, Robins said he’s waiting to see if the companies “put their money where their mouth is.” 
The cost of installing and maintaining the new filtration systems for communities across the state could exceed $1 billion, according to Robins, who said he’s working to make sure the manufacturers, not residents pay for it. 
Jenny Rempel with the grassroots group Community Water Center — which has been pushing for the state to set a legal limit on the chemical in the water — said the adoption of the limit was a “historic victory.” 
“Now we need to make sure communities get the funding they need to get TCP out of their water,” Rempel said. 
Asha Kreiling, policy and communication analyst with the Community Water Center said, “When we tell people about 1,2,3-TCP and the health risks and the fact that it’s been in the water for so long and that it’s been unregulated for so long and that it’s really these companies whose fault it is, people are really upset. People talk about their family members or their friends or even just pockets of their neighborhood where they know people are getting cancer at abnormal levels.” 
Cal Water and the city of Bakersfield sued the chemical companies over 10 years ago in an effort to recoup the costs of treating the contamination, and that case is still ongoing. The chemical companies have already settled eight cases regarding contamination by TCP. 
Water Rates Many California residents living in poor communities, especially in agricultural areas where the pesticide containing the chemical was most widely used, may soon be paying much higher water bills in order to pay for the filtering out of the chemical from their drinking water. 
Some communities already have to drink bottled water to avoid drinking the contaminated water coming from their taps. 
At least one family is Visalia told the State Water Board they spend $800 a year on water due to the presence of TCP at a level 15 times that allowed under the newly-adopted limit. 
On July 19 — just one day after the state adopted the limit for TCP in drinking water — the Bakersfield City Council unanimously voted to increase water rates by 41 percent over the next two years to pay for the filtering out of the chemical. The city’s 46,000 ratepayers are expected to get their first rate increase is in October 2017. 
Ratepayers could get back some of that money via the pending lawsuit against the chemical companies. 
According to the Bakersfield Californian , the proposed rate hikes – to come in three phases – would increase the typical city water customer’s bill from roughly $36 to roughly $50 per month. 
Ratepayers in other cities, such as Arvin, are looking at a water bill that is ten times higher than their current rates. 
“To pay for the kind of filtration system that’s needed, you’d be talking about raising consumer rates probably tenfold,” said Raul Barraza Jr., general manager of the Arvin Community Services District. 
Barraza told the State Water Board that the limit will make litigation against these companies much easier. 
Barraza said Arvin and other Central Valley water systems “are looking to Dow and Shell, the companies who well knowingly polluted our groundwater with their defective pesticide, which contain an unnecessary ingredient of 1,2,3‐TCP, to step up and do the right thing. And pay for the damage they have caused.” 
Some community officials say they won’t be able to comply as quickly as required. 
The City of Chino, the Monte Vista Water District and the Chino Water Desalter Authority told the State Water Board that their agencies “will be forced into noncompliance, which will require us to either turn off wells and/or notify our customers that their water no longer meets public health requirements. The result of such noncompliance is a severe reduction in water supply reliability, liability to lawsuits, and a loss of public trust.” 
While water districts wait on pending lawsuits and potential settlements, the State Water Board’s Division of Drinking Water District is offering technical support, loans and grants to public water systems that cannot afford the new filtration systems. 
Company Response Dow AgroSciences, in a statement to CBS San Francisco on Thursday said, “TCP was a trace constituent associated with highly beneficial agricultural product formulations, which have not been on the market for several decades, that controlled pests that otherwise would have caused millions of dollars in annual crop losses.” 
Dow said, “TCP is also associated with products that Dow did not manufacture or sell and with certain industrial processes in which Dow had no involvement.” 
Shell spokeswoman Kimberly Windon provided CBS San Francisco with a statement highlighting the benefits to farmers of the soil fumigant containing TCP that they manufactured and noted that other products not manufactured by Shell also contained TCP. 
Windon said, “Although we appreciate the State’s hard work in considering the technological feasibility of a Maximum Contaminant Level at this level, the state has not conducted an appropriate economic feasibility analysis, as is required by law. A study by the California Manufacturers & Technology Association clearly shows that the proposed standard is not economically feasible, requiring a level of remediation that risks raising the cost of water provision without proven significant health benefit.” 
Neither Dow nor Shell would answer questions about why they disposed of 1,2,3-TCP via the pesticides they manufactured, nor would they answer questions about which years their product was used. They also failed to answer questions about where in the world their products containing 1,2,3-TCP ended up. 
Neither chemical company would answer questions regarding when they first learned that the chemical was a carcinogen and when they stopped putting TCP into their pesticide products.

( Natural News ) The water supply of a million Central California residents is contaminated with what is considered one of the most powerful carcinogens on the planet, and now the state is making a move to try to get the problem under control as the lawsuits against the companies responsible for the contamination continue to pile up. [RELATED: Dehydrated – CA residents’ drinking water reservoir nearly empty .] 
According to NBC News , some people believe that the substance known as 1,2,3-trichloropropane, or TCP, in the water is behind the health problems plaguing those who live in the Arvin area. 
Oregon Health and Science University’s Professor Paul Tratnyek, who studied the substance for the U.S. Department of Defense, said its toxicity is nearly unmatched by other chemicals. He noted that even tiny amounts of TCP in the water could cause health effects. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, it is “likely to be carcinogenic to humans.” 
The California State Water Resources Control Board has now voted to set the limit of this substance in drinking water at 5 parts per trillion , and all wells in the state will be tested for it monthly starting this January. This will give water companies six months to fix any of the wells that are affected. The board’s vice chair, Steven Moore, applauded the move, saying that “it is disquieting how serious and insidious this chemical is.” 
Exposure comes from drinking water that is contaminated with TCP or from cooking with it, showering in it, or otherwise inhaling its steam – for example, while washing dishes.

In Bakersfield, city water rates are poised to climb 41 percent over the next two years to cover the $55 million cost of ridding its waters of TCP. The city is currently in the middle of a lawsuit against Dow and Shell in hopes of recouping some of the costs and mitigating the rate increase. 
Arvin is a low-income area, and not everyone can easily pay for bottled water or water filters like the Big Berkey to clean their drinking water . On top of that, they still have to pay their water bills even though the water they are getting is toxic. Residents say the water has a bad smell and a chemical taste, and they are outraged that they are being forced to pay for a product that could kill them. 
Unfortunately, this problem is not merely confined to California. After collecting data from water utilities around the country, the Environmental Working Group found that TCP is present in the water supplies of at least 17 states. A partial list is available on their website .

104,"Farm communities face contaminated water from manure, nitrates, records reveal",Special to The Oregonian,2017-08-15,"Farm communities face contaminated water from manure, nitrates, records reveal Comment Updated on August 15, 2017 at 1:09 PM Posted on August 15, 2017 at 1:08 PM 
By Jackie Wang, Nicole Tyau and Chelsea Rae Ybanez 
Yakima County in Washington state, home to around 67 dairy farms, sits on aquifers contaminated by nitrates. 
In California's San Joaquin Valley, which grows nearly one-quarter of the nation's food, fertilizer and manure spread on farms' fields and orchards have contributed to unsafe nitrate levels in drinking water sources. 
The drinking water of millions of Americans living in or near farming communities across the country is contaminated by dangerous amounts of nitrates and coliform bacteria from fertilizer and manure widely used in agriculture, a News21 analysis of Environmental Protection Agency records shows. The records reveal that community water systems serving over 2 million people across the country were cited for excessive nitrate levels. 
Those records don't cover the millions of private wells that many Americans use, which are left vulnerable to pollution of shallow groundwater in agricultural areas. 
Many farmworkers who live in these communities still have to pay for the contaminated water coming from the faucet, as well as buying bottled water to drink. But the farmers who employ them don't agree with their concerns. More information This report is part of a project on drinking water contamination in the United States produced by the Carnegie-Knight News21 program. See the entire project and documentary here. ""They say, 'Why are you complaining? You have jobs? We are giving you jobs. You eat because of us,' "" said Irma Medellin, who works with Latino farmworkers in Tulare County to clean up the drinking water. ""They contaminate our water, and we, the poor, are paying for water as if we were rich. And we are not rich. But we are paying the price of contaminated water.""
While the analysis shows 5,000 nitrate violations can largely be traced back to agricultural activity, 22,971 total coliform violations could be from either human or animal feces. However, in heavily farmed areas, much of the coliform bacteria can be attributed to manure. 
A 2012 University of California, Davis, study attributed high nitrate levels in the San Joaquin Valley groundwater to crop and animal agriculture activities based on an analysis of land use and the amount of nitrogen entering the water. Farmers' heavy use of fertilizers and manure on their crops account for most of the nitrate found in the studied area. 
People living farther away from agricultural areas also are vulnerable to farming pollution because contaminants can flow downstream in rivers and groundwater. 
FARMING-CONTAMINATED DRINKING WATER POSES SERIOUS HEALTH RISKS 
Two of the most prominent farming contaminants in water are nitrates and total coliform bacteria. 
Nitrate-related contamination comes from fertilizer for crops and manure. The body digests nitrates and turns it into nitrites, which inhibits red blood cells' ability to carry oxygen. The EPA limits nitrate levels to prevent infants from contracting blue baby syndrome, a potentially fatal disorder that deprives infants of oxygen. Research indicates that long-term exposure may affect adults as well. 
For the past 20 years, National Cancer Institute researcher Mary Ward has been researching drinking water contaminants, focusing on nitrates and cancer risk. She followed a group of people in Iowa to do so. Though studies need to be repeated before drawing conclusions, she said her research suggests drinking water with high levels of nitrates increases the risk for gastrointestinal and urinary tract cancers. 
Tom Nolan, a hydrologist with the USGS, said in agriculturally intense areas, it's fair to say the majority of nitrate pollution comes from agricultural sources. 
""That's just because that's where the sources are,"" Nolan said. ""In agricultural areas, there are higher applications of fertilizer ... You can look at (nitrate) exceedance rates and they're highest in shallow groundwater in agricultural areas."" 
Fertilizer and manure not only increase nitrates in drinking water sources, but also fuel algae blooms that make water unsafe to drink and harder to treat. Cyanobacteria grows in phosphorous-heavy waters, which is primarily caused by manure and fertilizer runoff. Also known as blue-green algae, cyanobacteria becomes problematic for drinking water systems in treatment facilities. During the sanitation process, water treatment facilities apply chemicals to kill the cyanobacteria. When the cell dies, it releases cyanotoxins, which can have health effects ranging from fever to pneumonia to death, according to the EPA. 
""The blue-green algae is not regulated. There's no EPA requirement to test for it,"" said Bill Stowe, the CEO and general manager of Des Moines Water Works. ""We test for it because we know from our experience that it is an adverse risk that is unregulated now, but smaller communities don't have the resources or knowledge to do that."" 
Beyond the problems cyanotoxins create, the chemicals that kill the algae react with organic material in the water and create disinfection byproducts, which increase cancer risk. The News21 analysis showed that water systems across the U.S. were cited over 28,000 times in the last decade for exceeding the byproduct legal limit, exposing over 25 million people to unsafe levels. 
Cyanotoxins and cyanobacteria ""are significant risks for us because we increase our use of chlorine,"" Stowe said. ""When you increase one, you increase the likelihood of creating carcinogens."" 
The other major source of water contamination from farming is total coliform bacteria from raw, untreated manure. When rain falls on recently fertilized fields, it pushes contaminants from the surface deeper into the soil, and eventually into groundwater. People can see and smell the brown water from their taps. But in the days before or after, water can continue to be contaminated even if the water runs clear. 
Drinking water with total coliform bacteria can cause gastrointestinal illnesses, which are linked to diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea and fever. 
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION OF AGRICULTURE IS MOSTLY VOLUNTARY 
On a still day in the northwest corner of Washington state, a brown, swirling pool burps methane as liquid manure shoots from a pipe propped up by a tractor. But when a breeze comes by, the smell of 1.5 million gallons of liquid cow manure hits the nose and then lingers in the back of the throat for hours. 
This is the manure lagoon on Terry Lenssen's 710-cow dairy farm. Lenssen has only fallen into his manure lagoon once, accidentally backing a tractor into the pit. He's steered clear of the lagoon ever since. 
Thousands of dairy farmers around the United States store their cows' manure like Lenssen does, in separate forms: liquid into a large pit, and the solids heaped into soft, dry mountains. Hog and chicken farmers also store vast amounts of manure to use later as fertilizer. 
Dairy farmers usually take the liquid manure and apply it to their fields where they grow corn and alfalfa to feed their cattle. But when a farmer applies too much manure for plants to absorb, the rest finds its way out. In addition to that, lagoons can spill over or spring a leak. In a 2013 report about the Lower Yakima Valley in Washington state, the EPA estimated one dairy's lagoon leaked between 482,000 to 5.9 million gallons of liquid manure per year into the surrounding soil. 
The EPA started regulating what goes into federal waterways in the 1972 Clean Water Act amendments. Many industries must apply for permits that allow certain discharges into national waterways. But farming is exempt from the Clean Water Act, unless the EPA designates a farm as a concentrated animal feeding operation. 
And many operations have not applied for discharge permits. Although the number of feed operations increased by 956 between 2011 and 2016 to a total of 19,496 in the United States, the number of discharge permits has gone down 1,806 in the same five-year period. 
Lenssen has not registered as a concentrated feeding operation yet. Washington state implemented a new permit in March, but both environmental groups and dairy organizations immediately filed appeals against the new regulations. In the meantime, Lenssen has a 2-inch-thick binder holding his voluntary nutrient management plan as a testament to his environmental responsibility. 
Nutrient management plans are intended to hold farmers accountable for what they apply and how much of it. States decide if they require these plans and how detailed they need to be. While some states, such as Maryland, require farmers to work with a certified professional to construct a nutrient management plan, others don't require consultation with an engineer or nutrient management expert, and farmers can submit their own plans for approval. 
""Frankly, if I was to go and open a business today, I would need a business plan but also a permit of some kind,"" said Meyer, of the Ohio Environmental Council. ""Why shouldn't one of the largest industries in the United States be required to have a permit?"" 
The Natural Resources Conservation Service, an arm of the Department of Agriculture, works with farmers to craft nutrient management plans on a voluntary basis. Each region of the U.S. has different priorities in its plans. Groundwater varies by geographic location. Conditions in one region of a state may drastically differ from a neighboring region of the same state. Aquifers are underground sections of rock that water moves through, and the type and amount of rock, soil and gravel it contains vary by region. Porous rock, such as karst, allows surface water to move quickly into the aquifer below, making it more vulnerable to contamination. 
FARMERS AND THOSE SUPPORTED BY FARMERS' MONEY SHAPE AGRICULTURAL POLICY 
If an aquifer is contaminated, the private wells that draw water from it become contaminated too. 
Larry Fendell, a 60-year-old ex-farmer, regularly attends Lower Yakima Valley groundwater meetings. Stakeholders first met in 2012 to solve nitrate contamination problems in the Lower Yakima Valley groundwater, but Fendell has been fighting for stricter regulations of large dairy farms for 20 years. 
""And even if there are regulations, so many things are suggestions,"" Fendell said. ""Nutrient management plans are suggestions. There's no teeth behind them. Everything is voluntary."" 
Dairyman Dan DeGroot represents the Yakima Dairy Foundation at the meetings. He's part of the advisory committee steering the research and planning to reduce nitrate concentration in groundwater. DeGroot said he defends himself from people who accuse dairy farms of being the biggest polluter of groundwater. 
""I said, 'You know what, I care more about drinking water than any of you people in here,'"" DeGroot said. ""It's of critical importance because I've got 3,500 animals, plus 35 people, plus seven in my family – all drinking this water. I care. A lot."" 
Though Yakima County is 49 percent Hispanic, the 22-person groundwater management board is all white, save for one Latino representing the Washington State Department of Health. It has not had an active Latino community representative since April. This leaves an already vulnerable community out of the discussion to remedy high nitrate levels, which significantly affect lower-income Latino farmworkers who rely on private wells. 
For over three decades, the American Farm Bureau Federation has pushed to exempt farming from environmental regulation. For example, fertilizer and manure are not regulated by the Clean Water Act because agricultural activities are considered ""nonpoint source pollution,"" which means it comes from many sources. 
In 2015, a federal judge ruled that over-applied manure could be regulated as waste after examining a case brought against a Washington dairy. The Washington State Dairy Federation, dairy organizations and farm publications opposed the ruling, but also cautioned dairy farms to exceed manure management expectations and prove that more environmental regulation was unnecessary. 
U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse, a well-to-do farmer and Republican congressman who represents farming-focused counties in Washington state, even filed a bill that would exempt fertilizer and animal manure from being regulated as solid waste entirely. Out of the $747,916 Newhouse received from political action committees between 2015 to 2016, 29 percent came from agriculture and food-related PACs. 
The American Farm Bureau alone spent almost $3.8 million in lobbying nationally in the 2016 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The center also reported agribusiness organizations – which include farming, food production and stores – spent $127.5 million last year in lobbying the federal government. 
Back in California, the Division of Drinking Water is supplying 20 communities in the agricultural San Joaquin Valley with bottled water because of nitrate or coliform bacteria pollution. According to the News21 analysis, the most nitrate citations in the United States over the past 10 years were recorded in Tulare County, which is in the valley. Though nitrates and bacteria are currently below the legal limit, the department still delivers water to them because of historic issues with contamination. 
Each resident of unincorporated community Tooleville in Tulare County receives half a gallon of water for drinking and cooking per day, delivered every month and paid for by the state. For many residents, it isn't enough. 
One Tooleville resident, Esther Ceballos, buys extra cases of water for herself, her two children and her husband. She still pays $40 a month for tap water she does not use for drinking or cooking. 
Rosa Rubio, who lives next to Ceballos, relies on the bottled water delivery for herself, her husband and their four dogs. She said they've known their water was undrinkable since they first moved in, thanks to a neighbor who warned them. Sometimes, their tap water comes out white. 
""Even if they say it's OK, we're scared to use that water,"" she said.

105,Farming activity contaminates water despite best practices,Chelsea Rae Ybanez,2017-08-16,"This report is part of a project on drinking water contamination in the United States produced by the Carnegie-Knight  News21  program. 
CASCO, Wis. – Lynda Cochart did not realize her water was contaminated with coliform bacteria until she contracted MRSA, an antibiotic-resistant skin infection. She believed it came from the water in her well in Casco, Wisconsin. “There’s no other way I could have gotten it,” she said.
A year later, U.S. Department of Agriculture microbiologist Mark Borchardt tested her well while testing others in Kewaunee County. He found total coliform bacteria at levels too dangerous to drink. Cochart lives between two dairy farms with over 1,000 cows each. None of the bacteria Borchardt found came from human feces, she said, so the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus most likely came from cow manure. Borchardt told her to immediately stop drinking the water.
“He said, ‘What I found in your well is what I expect to find in a Third World country,’” Cochart recalled. When she told him she still needed to shower with that water, Borchardt advised, “Then keep your eyes closed and your mouth shut.”
In California’s San Joaquin Valley, which grows nearly one-quarter of the nation’s food, fertilizer and manure spread on farms’ fields and orchards have contributed to unsafe nitrate levels in drinking water sources. The News21 analysis of Environmental Protection Agency records of community water systems shows 491 instances of unsafe nitrate amounts in many of the region’s 663 community water systems over the past 10 years.
Many farmworkers who live in these communities still have to pay for the contaminated water coming from the faucet, as well as buying bottled water to drink. But the farmers who employ them don’t agree with their concerns.
“They say, ‘Why are you complaining? You have jobs? We are giving you jobs. You eat because of us,’ ” said Irma Medellin, who works with Latino farmworkers in Tulare County to clean up the drinking water. “They contaminate our water, and we, the poor, are paying for water as if we were rich. And we are not rich. But we are paying the price of contaminated water.”
The News21 analysis shows that the drinking water of millions of Americans living in or near farming communities across the country is contaminated by dangerous amounts of nitrates and coliform bacteria from fertilizer and manure widely used in agriculture. Community water systems serving over 2 million people across the country were cited for excessive nitrate levels.
While the 5,050 nitrate violations can largely be traced back to agricultural activity, the 22,971 total coliform violations could be from either human or animal feces. However, in heavily farmed areas, much of the coliform bacteria can be attributed to manure.
Those records don’t cover the millions of private wells that many Americans use, which are left vulnerable to pollution of shallow groundwater in agricultural areas.
A 2012 University of California, Davis, study attributed high nitrate levels in the San Joaquin Valley groundwater to crop and animal agriculture activities based on an analysis of land use and the amount of nitrogen entering the water. Farmers’ heavy use of fertilizers and manure on their crops account for most of the nitrate found in the studied area.
An Iowa Geological Survey researcher found in 2004 that row crops, such as corn, cotton and soybeans, contributed the most to high nitrate levels in Iowa’s rivers. In 2007, U.S. Geological Survey researchers found that Iowa was one of nine Midwestern farming states that contributed over 75 percent of the nitrates that flow from the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico. And a 2010 study by researchers from the University of Illinois and Cornell University found that the biggest contributors of excessive nitrate to the Mississippi River were in the Midwestern corn belt.
People living farther away from agricultural areas also are vulnerable to farming pollution because contaminants can flow downstream in rivers and groundwater.
In Wisconsin, the USDA’s Borchardt tracked manure runoff from a field to the tap water of a nearby home after the water ran brown. Three days later, genetic testing showed the same bacteria traveled 1,500 feet through groundwater to another home’s well.
In 2016 , the Columbus Division of Water issued a nitrate contamination warning not to drink the city’s water after heavy rain pushed fertilizer into a watershed 60 miles north of the Ohio city, the second nitrate advisory in two years.
“They’re increasing,” said Kristy Meyer, who oversees the Ohio Environmental Council’s water programs as the managing director of natural resources. “Now you’re starting to see drinking water utilities spend a lot more money to be able to treat the water and keep their customers safe.”
For example, Des Moines, Iowa, is surrounded by farms that grow the most corn, soybeans, eggs and hogs in the nation. Fertilizer and stored manure drain into the groundwater and flow into streams and rivers, leaving people to pay to treat their drinking water.
The Des Moines Water Works, which serves half a million people in Iowa’s capital, draws most of its water from the Raccoon River and Des Moines River. The utility shelled out over $2 million from 2013 to 2015 to reduce nitrates to safe drinking standards, and will soon have to spend up to $183.5 million to build a new treatment facility.
Des Moines Water Works sued three northern Iowa counties in 2015, accusing the 10 drainage districts in those counties of dumping nitrates into the Raccoon River without a federal permit. The river runs for 186 miles from Buena Vista County to the Des Moines River, south of downtown Des Moines. The drainage districts use “tile drainage,” which moves groundwater directly under the soil through underground pipes and into the river, turning saturated land into farmable land.
The Iowa Supreme Court dismissed the case earlier this year because state law protects drainage districts from lawsuits. Though the drainage districts were not penalized, studies point to agricultural runoff as a major contributor of nitrates in the Raccoon River.
Farming-contaminated drinking water poses serious health risks 
Two of the most prominent farming contaminants in water are nitrates and total coliform bacteria.
Nitrate-related contamination comes from fertilizer for crops and manure. The body digests nitrates and turns it into nitrites, which inhibits red blood cells’ ability to carry oxygen. The EPA limits nitrate levels to prevent infants from contracting blue baby syndrome, a potentially fatal disorder that deprives infants of oxygen. Research indicates that long-term exposure may affect adults as well.
For the past 20 years, National Cancer Institute researcher Mary Ward has been researching drinking water contaminants, focusing on nitrates and cancer risk. She followed a group of people in Iowa to do so. Though studies need to be repeated before drawing conclusions, she said her research suggests drinking water with high levels of nitrates increases the risk for gastrointestinal and urinary tract cancers.
Tom Nolan, a hydrologist with the USGS, said in agriculturally intense areas, it’s fair to say the majority of nitrate pollution comes from agricultural sources.
“That’s just because that’s where the sources are,” Nolan said. “In agricultural areas, there are higher applications of fertilizer … You can look at (nitrate) exceedance rates and they’re highest in shallow groundwater in agricultural areas.”
Fertilizer and manure not only increase nitrates in drinking water sources, but also fuel algae blooms that make water unsafe to drink and harder to treat. Cyanobacteria grows in phosphorous-heavy waters, which is primarily caused by manure and fertilizer runoff. Also known as blue-green algae, cyanobacteria becomes problematic for drinking water systems in treatment facilities. During the sanitation process, water treatment facilities apply chemicals to kill the cyanobacteria. When the cell dies, it releases cyanotoxins, which can have health effects ranging from fever to pneumonia to death, according to the EPA.
“The blue-green algae is not regulated. There’s no EPA requirement to test for it,” said Bill Stowe, the CEO and general manager of Des Moines Water Works. “We test for it because we know from our experience that it is an adverse risk that is unregulated now, but smaller communities don’t have the resources or knowledge to do that.”
Beyond the problems cyanotoxins create, the chemicals that kill the algae react with organic material in the water and create disinfection byproducts (DBPs), which increase cancer risk. The News21 analysis showed that water systems across the U.S. were cited over 28,000 times in the last decade for exceeding the DBP legal limit, exposing over 25 million people to unsafe levels of DBPs.
Cyanotoxins and cyanobacteria “are significant risks for us because we increase our use of chlorine,” Stowe said. “When you increase one, you increase the likelihood of creating carcinogens.”
The other major source of water contamination from farming is total coliform bacteria from raw, untreated manure. When rain falls on recently fertilized fields, it pushes contaminants from the surface deeper into the soil, and eventually into groundwater. People can see and smell the brown water from their taps. But in the days before or after, water can continue to be contaminated even if the water runs clear.
Drinking water with total coliform bacteria can cause gastrointestinal illnesses, which are linked to diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea and fever.
The California Division of Drinking Water is supplying 20 communities in the agricultural San Joaquin Valley with bottled water because of nitrate or coliform bacteria pollution. According to the News21 analysis, the most nitrate citations in the United States over the past 10 years were recorded in Tulare County, which is in the valley. Though nitrates and bacteria are currently below the legal limit, the department still delivers water to them because of historic issues with contamination.
Each resident of unincorporated community Tooleville in Tulare County receives half a gallon of water for drinking and cooking per day, delivered every month and paid for by the state. For many residents, it isn’t enough.
One Tooleville resident, Esther Ceballos, buys extra cases of water for herself, her two children and her husband. She still pays $40 a month for tap water she does not use for drinking or cooking.
Rosa Rubio, who lives next to Ceballos, relies on the bottled water delivery for herself, her husband and their four dogs. She said they’ve known their water was undrinkable since they first moved in, thanks to a neighbor who warned them. Sometimes, their tap water comes out white.
“Even if they say it’s OK, we’re scared to use that water,” she said.
Environmental regulation of agriculture is mostly voluntary 
On a still day in the northwest corner of Washington state, a brown, swirling pool burps methane as liquid manure shoots from a pipe propped up by a tractor. But when a breeze comes by, the smell of 1.5 million gallons of liquid cow manure hits the nose and then lingers in the back of the throat for hours.
This is the manure lagoon on Terry Lenssen’s 710-cow dairy farm. Lenssen has only fallen into his manure lagoon once, accidentally backing a tractor into the pit. He’s steered clear of the lagoon ever since. “I smelled like shit for three days,” he laughed. “Must get into your pores or something.
Thousands of dairy farmers around the United States store their cows’ manure like Lenssen does, in separate forms: liquid into a large pit, and the solids heaped into soft, dry mountains. Hog and chicken farmers also store vast amounts of manure to use later as fertilizer.
Dairy farmers usually take the liquid manure and apply it to their fields where they grow corn and alfalfa to feed their cattle. But when a farmer applies too much manure for plants to absorb, the rest finds its way out. In addition to that, lagoons can spill over or spring a leak. In a 2013 report about the Lower Yakima Valley in Washington state, the EPA estimated one dairy’s lagoon leaked between 482,000 to 5.9 million gallons of liquid manure per year into the surrounding soil.
The EPA started regulating what goes into federal waterways in the 1972 Clean Water Act amendments . Many industries must apply for National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits, which allow certain discharges into national waterways. But farming is exempt from the Clean Water Act, unless the EPA designates a farm as a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO).
And many CAFOs have not applied for discharge permits. Although the number of CAFOs increased by 956 between 2011 and 2016 to a total of 19,496 in the United States, the number of discharge permits held by CAFOs has gone down 1,806 in the same five-year period.
Lenssen has not registered as a CAFO yet. Washington state implemented a new CAFO permit in March, but both environmental groups and dairy organizations immediately filed appeals against the new regulations. In the meantime, Lenssen has a 2-inch-thick binder holding his voluntary nutrient management plan as a testament to his environmental responsibility.
Nutrient management plans are intended to hold farmers accountable for what they apply and how much of it. States decide if they require these plans and how detailed they need to be. While some states, such as Maryland , require farmers to work with a certified professional to construct a nutrient management plan, others don’t require consultation with an engineer or nutrient management expert, and farmers can submit their own plans for approval.

Farmers and those supported by farmers' money shape agricultural policy 
If an aquifer is contaminated, the private wells that draw water from it become contaminated too. Yakima County in Washington state, home to around 67 dairy farms , sits on aquifers the EPA determined to be contaminated by nitrates.
Larry Fendell, a 60-year-old ex-farmer, regularly attends Lower Yakima Valley Groundwater Management Area (GWMA) meetings. Its board first met in 2012 to solve nitrate contamination problems in the Lower Yakima Valley groundwater, but Fendell has been fighting for stricter regulations of large dairy farms for 20 years.

The center also reported agribusiness organizations – which include farming, food production and stores – spent $127.5 million last year in lobbying the federal government.
Local farming lobbyist Steve George joined a tour of a Washington dairy farm by dairymen Jason Sheehan and DeGroot for News21. George is secretary of the Yakima County Farm Bureau, has been active as a spokesman for the Washington State Dairy Federation and works as a dairy nutrition consultant.
Keeping his arms crossed and his sunglasses on a furrowed brow, George occasionally interjected his thoughts into the conversation while following the dairy tour group closely, always making sure no one was alone with the reporters. Like other dairy operators News21 spoke with, George pointed to leaky septic systems as an underrepresented contributor of nitrate to drinking water sources, compared with farming.
Yet according to the federal conservation service , manure from a dairy milking 200 cows produces as much nitrogen as is in the sewage from a community of 5,000 to 10,000 people.
George and DeGroot criticized the terms “corporate” and “factory farming,” arguing the words are only used as fuel for environmental activists to attack farms.
“What is factory farming?” DeGroot asked. “To me, I always considered that to be kind of a good thing, comparing me to a factory that is very organized, very smooth, efficient. That’s what it feels like to me.”

Tom Steyer , the San Francisco billionaire and environmentalist, promised his support Tuesday for a proposed safe and affordable drinking water fund to help communities with contaminated water in the San Joaquin Valley. 
“It’s unjust for a million Californians to be exposed to unsafe water on a daily basis,” Steyer said. “That just can’t be right and we’ve got to find the money to solve it.” 
Steyer met with about a dozen water advocates at the nonprofit Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability in downtown Fresno who urged him to throw his clout behind Senate Bill 623. Legislation introduced by Sen. Bill Monning, D-Monterey, wouldestablish the Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund to provide an ongoing source of funding to ensure all Californians have access to safe and affordable drinking water. 
According to the state, 36 public water systems serving more than 35,000 people in Fresno County are currently out of compliance for a range of contaminants, including arsenic and nitrates. And of 306 communities across California that are out of compliance with primary safe drinking water standards, 154 are in the eight counties of the Valley. The 154 water systems serve 218,000 people. 
Lucy Hernandez, representing Agua Coalition y West Goshen, told Steyer: “In our community, we had three days and three nights without water because our well collapsed; and it was like the worst days of our lives.” 
In our community, we had three days and three nights without water because our well collapsed; and it was like the worst days of our lives. 
Lucy Hernandez, Agua Coalition y West Goshen 
Hernandez said she would like Steyer “to use your influence to talk to people that you know that have the power to change this and to support this bill for us.” 
Steyer, who created the nonprofit NextGen Climate, has renamed the organization NextGen America and expanded its mission beyond environmental issues to include health care, immigration rights and equality. 
During a news conference Tuesday, Steyer said in 2012 California declared that clean drinking water is a human right, but the state has not lived up to that pledge. Clean drinking water is a justice issue, he said. “People absolutely have a right to clean, safe drinking water.” 
Fresno has gained Steyer’s attention before. His wife, Kathryn “Kat” Taylor, came to the city two years ago. Her concern was water and air quality and the effects on the health of the people living here, he said. 
Susana DeAnda of the Community Water Center , a Visalia-based advocacy organization, said Steyer would be joining a grass roots movement. “We’re here to share a movement with you. This is not an issue from the top down – it is bottom up. And it’s very alive and we would like you to join this movement to create change and to believe in change.” 
Isabel Solorio of Community United in Lanare said residents have not received the help they need from county elected officials. 
It’s unjust for a million Californians to be exposed to unsafe water on a daily basis. 
Tom Steyer, California billionaire and founder of NextGen America 
Lanare, a community of about 600 residents north of Lemoore, has arsenic in the water – a naturally occurring chemical that consumed over the long term can lead to serious health problems, including cancer. A water treatment plant sits useless in the city because it’s too expensive to operate. Residents want new wells drilled that they hope will be arsenic-free. 
Steyer said politicians respond to votes, but Fresno County has a complicated web of environmental issues, including poor air and water quality, “which I feel at the heart is political because I feel this area and this city has been poorly represented.” 
Fresno County Supervisor Buddy Mendes, who farms near Lanare and represents the area, said he has been responsive to the community’s needs and has tried to help the residents get clean water. But the state has jurisdiction, he said. “The state needs to start listening to what I’m telling them if they want to fix the water problem.” 
Steyer said the political timing is now for passage of SB 623, and he’s positive about its success. “This month we really do have a chance to turn this around,” he said. Nationally, attention is focused on justice for everybody, he said. “As bad as Trump is, he makes the point that our system is not fair to everybody and everybody can look at that and say it should be fair to everybody. And that’s why I say, as strange as it is, I think this is a very good time to be making that argument and to be making this fight for clean water for everybody.” 
As for his own political ambitions, Steyer has been rumored to have an eye on the governor’s race, but on Tuesday he laughed off a question about a run for the top state office. The former hedge fund manager, who has donated heavily to Democratic candidates, said he gets asked the question a lot. “I haven’t made up my mind,” he said. Never miss a local story.

107,Drinking water tax to fix California public systems,Katy Murphy kmurphy@bayareanewsgroup.com,2017-08-24,"Breaking News Drinking water tax to fix California public systems Filling glass of water from stainless steel kitchen faucet. A new tax proposed in the California legislature would increase household water bills by $11.40 per year. By Katy Murphy, # Comments 
SACRAMENTO >> For the first time Californians would pay a tax on drinking water, 95 cents per month, under legislation aimed at fixing hundreds of public water systems with unsafe tap water. 
Senate Bill 623, backed by a strange-bedfellows coalition of the agricultural lobby and environmental groups but opposed by water districts, would generate $2 billion over the next 15 years to clean up contaminated groundwater and improve faulty water systems and wells. The problem is most pervasive in rural areas with agricultural runoff. 
“My message is short and direct: We are not Flint, Michigan,” co-author Sen. Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, said at a Wednesday rally outside the Capitol, where demonstrators held signs reading “Clean water is not a luxury” and “Water is a human right.” 
Ironically, many Californians are more aware of the crisis in Flint — where state and local officials in 2015 told residents about lead contamination in the drinking water, after claiming it was safe to drink — than about the water problems in their home state, said the measure’s main author, Sen. Bill Monning, D-Monterey. He called this “a pivotal time in our state’s history to do the right thing.” 
SB623 has been moving through the Legislature for months, but was amended Monday to include the tax on water for both homes and businesses. It also imposes fees on farms and dairies, roughly $30 million annually, to address some of the contamination caused by fertilizers and other chemicals. Because it includes new taxes, the proposal will need a two-thirds vote in each house to pass, which supporters concede will be a battle. 
Still, Monning has been able to forge the unusual alliance of farmers and environmental groups, which rarely agree on public policy. He also has the support of at least one Republican lawmaker: Sen. Andy Vidak, a cherry farmer who said his Central Valley district — which includes Hanford, Fresno and Bakersfield — is the epicenter of the drinking-water problem. 
“This is very, very important to my constituents,” he said after the rally, as some of them began chanting on the Capitol steps. “This is one of the most important things in my district.” 
But water agencies say taxing drinking water sets a dangerous precedent and that the bill would turn them into state tax collectors. “Water is essential to life. Should we tax drinking water? We don’t think so,” said Cindy Tuck, a spokeswoman for the Association of California Water Agencies. 
Sue Stephenson, a spokeswoman for the Dublin San Ramon Services District, said she supported the intent of the proposal — safe drinking water for all — but argued that lawmakers should use the money in existing coffers. Advertisement 
“The whole purpose of the general fund is to help take care of disadvantaged communities,” she said. “There’s no reason that they could not also fund communities that need access to drinking water.” 
Marie Barajas, of San Jose, had a similar reaction. “That’s not fair. We’re not responsible for that,” she said. “That’s why we pay taxes.”

SACRAMENTO >> Californians would for the first time pay a tax on drinking water — 95 cents per month — under legislation to fix hundreds of public water systems with unsafe tap water — a problem that’s most pervasive in rural areas with agricultural runoff. 
Senate Bill 623 — backed by a strange-bedfellows coalition of the agricultural lobby and environmental groups, but opposed by water districts — would generate $2 billion in the next 15 years to clean up contaminated groundwater and improve faulty water systems and wells. 
“My message is short and direct: We are not Flint, Michigan,” said co-author Sen. Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, at a Wednesday rally outside the Capitol, where demonstrators held signs reading “Clean water is not a luxury” and “Water is a human right.” 
Ironically, many Californians are more aware of the crisis in Flint — where officials in 2015 told residents about lead contamination in the drinking water, after claiming it was safe to drink — than about the water problems in their home state, said the measure’s author, State Sen. Bill Monning, D-Monterey. He called this “a pivotal time in our state’s history to do the right thing.” 
SB 623 has been moving through the Legislature for months, but was amended Monday to include the tax on water for both homes and businesses. It also imposes fees on farms and dairies — roughly $30 million annually — to address some of the contamination caused by fertilizers and other chemicals. Because it includes new fees, the proposal will need a two-thirds vote in each house to pass, which supporters concede will be a battle. 
But Monning has forged the unusual alliance of farmers and environmental groups, which rarely agree on public policy. He also has the support of at least one Republican lawmaker: Sen. Andy Vidak, a cherry farmer who said his Central Valley district — which includes Hanford, Fresno and Bakersfield — is the epicenter of the drinking-water problem. 
“This is very, very important to my constituents,” he said after the rally, as some of them began chanting on the Capitol steps. “This is one of the most important things in my district.” 
But water agencies say taxing drinking water sets a dangerous precedent and that the bill would turn them into state tax collectors. “Water is essential to life — should we tax drinking water? We don’t think so,” said Cindy Tuck, a spokeswoman for the Association of California Water Agencies. 
Sue Stephenson, a spokeswoman for the Dublin San Ramon Services District, said she supported the intent of the proposal — potable drinking water for all — but argued that lawmakers should use the money in existing coffers. Advertisement 
“The whole purpose of the general fund is to help take care of disadvantaged communities,” she said. “There’s no reason that they could not also fund communities that need access to drinking water.” 
Monning, however, argues that the general fund is too unreliable of a funding source — and that the proposed tax on households, amounting to roughly $11.40 per year, is negligible. “You’re not going to notice it on your water bill,” he said.

From Mercury News : For the first time Californians would pay a tax on drinking water — 95 cents per month — under legislation aimed at fixing hundreds of public water systems with unsafe tap water.

110,State senators must ask tough question of PUC nominees,Orange County Register Editorial Board,2017-08-22,"Opinion State senators must ask tough question of PUC nominees AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli State Sen. Kevin de Leon, D-Los Angeles, speaks in the Senate chamber Monday, Feb. 27, 2017, in Sacramento, Calif. By Orange County Register Editorial Board | letters@ocregister.com PUBLISHED: August 22, 2017 at 12:03 am | UPDATED: August 22, 2017 at 10:29 am There are some indications that Clifford Rechtschaffen, one of Gov. Jerry Brown’s two latest appointments to the state Public Utilities Commission, would be more of an advocate for utilities than for consumers, ratepayers and those adversely affected by environmental issues.
That’s why the Senate Rules Committee needs to ask tough questions of Rechtschaffen in his confirmation hearing this week.
In December, Brown appointed two of his advisers on environmental and climate change issues, Rechtschaffen and Martha Guzman Aceves, to six-year terms as PUC commissioners. They replaced outgoing Commissioners Mike Florio and Catherine Sandoval in January.
Rechtschaffen and Guzman Aceves will face the Rules Committee, chaired by Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León, D-Los Angeles, in their confirmation hearings Wednesday afternoon.
The two new appointees were in place when the PUC ruled it was safe to reopen Southern California Gas Co.’s Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility at a reduced capacity less than two years after the biggest methane leak in U.S. history displaced thousands of residents from the Porter Ranch area. Los Angeles County filed suit, arguing that the facility should not be allowed to operate until an independent investigation of the cause of the leak is complete — which seems a logical approach but was spurned by the PUC.
Liza Tucker of Consumer Watchdog sent an eight-page letter to de León, co-signed by leaders of Save Porter Ranch, Food & Water Watch, Rootskeeper and a law firm — opposing Rechtschaffen’s appointment “on the basis of Mr. Rechtschaffen’s record of favoring the oil and gas industry.”
The letter alleges that Rechtschaffen “fired two top oil and gas regulators, Derek Chernow and Elena Miller, who were trying to make oil and gas drilling safer.” Tucker cites a legal declaration by Chernow, as part of a lawsuit against the Brown administration and oil companies that claims they poisoned Kern County aquifers, as evidence that Rechtschaffen fired the two regulators at the behest of Occidental Petroleum, which subsequently donated $500,000 to support Brown’s Proposition 30 tax measure.
De León and the other senators on the Rules Committee need to get to the bottom of these allegations and satisfy themselves that they are groundless before confirming Rechtschaffen’s appointment.
They need to ask Rechtschaffen why he fired and replaced the two regulators. Was there pressure from Occidental or any other petroleum company to replace them? Did pressure, if any existed, come through the governor’s office?
And why the rush to reopen the Aliso Canyon facility? Could that decision not have been put off until the investigation of the cause of the blowout was complete? Did the decision put the financial interests of SoCalGas’s parent company, Sempra Energy, or anyone else ahead of the safety of neighboring residents?
The PUC’s reputation has been tarnished considerably by its failures in relation to the deadly explosion in San Bruno of a Pacific Gas & Electric gas line, and by alleged coordination between then-commission president Michael Peevey and Southern California Edison on who would pay for the San Onofre nuclear plant closure.
The Senate committee must satisfy itself that these new PUC appointees will represent the pocketbooks and the health and safety of the people of California above the financial interests of the state’s big utilities and energy companies.

Today, we look at how the state is working to ensure that right and where the biggest concerns for Californians are.
The California Water Resources Control Board ’s records show more than 266 water suppliers were not in compliance with drinking-water standards as of May 2018. Most of the violations were in the rural agricultural regions of the state.
“The central part of the state has many more water systems,” said Robert Brownwood, a deputy director for the sState Water Resources Control Board. “In California, any supply system that supplies five or more homes is a public water system. There are many small water systems in agricultural lands where pesticides, chemicals and organic compounds are often found in the water.”
The state’s Division of Drinking Water has about 260 engineers checking water quality throughout the state. Some cities have their own engineers. Los Angeles’ engineers conducts hundreds of tests daily. Orange County has about 50 water systems serving 3 million people, while Tulare County has 356 water systems serving less than 500,000 people.
The testing in many areas is done on an honor system in which water is sent routinely to labs across the state for monitoring. Those that do not comply or are found to falsify tests could be fined.
Mapping our water quality If the water in your area is found to be in violation, a written notice will be sent to you. The maps below show where public water systems have had violations or are in compliance.
You can see these maps online or search for water board exceedance/compliance status.
Counties with most water systems in 2014:1. Sonoma, 4252. Tulare, 3563. Kern, 3524. San Bernardino, 3434. Los Angeles, 3436. Monterey, 327
The most violations per county were in Fresno, Stanislaus, Madera, Tulare and Kern counties.
What’s being tested You might find contaminants in any tap water , but the type and level of contamination is what regular testing attempts to regulate. Some violations in California water-supply systems are for excessive amounts of uranium, arsenic and nitrates.The bulk of the testing is for two types of health hazards: 1. Acute risks: Types of containments (giardia, E. coli) that can cause sickness or death after one glass of water. 2. Long-term risk: Types of containments (lead, arsenic and uranium) that if consumed in three liters of water a day can increase cancer risk.Funding is available from the state for water systems that are trying to get their systems in compliance.
Lead in schools The state of California has required community water systems to conduct lead sampling of drinking water in all public K-12 schools by July 2019 (with the exception of schools that have already sampled since 2009, schools that provide their own water supply or schools that were built or modified after 2010).This map built by ESRI shows where schools have had lead in their water higher than 15 parts per billion.

SACRAMENTO >> For the first time Californians would pay a tax on drinking water, 95 cents per month, under legislation to fix hundreds of public water systems with unsafe tap water — a problem that’s most pervasive in rural areas with agricultural runoff. 
Senate Bill 623, backed by a strange-bedfellows coalition of the agricultural lobby and environmental groups but opposed by water districts, would generate $2 billion over the next 15 years to clean up contaminated groundwater and improve faulty water systems and wells. 
“My message is short and direct: We are not Flint, Michigan,” co-author Sen. Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, said at a Wednesday rally outside the Capitol, where demonstrators held signs reading “Clean water is not a luxury” and “Water is a human right.” 
Ironically, many Californians are more aware of the crisis in Flint — where state and local officials in 2015 told residents about lead contamination in the drinking water, after claiming it was safe to drink — than about the water problems in their home state, said the measure’s main author, Sen. Bill Monning, D-Monterey. He called this “a pivotal time in our state’s history to do the right thing.” 
SB 623 has been moving through the Legislature for months, but was amended Monday to include the tax on water for both homes and businesses. It also imposes taxes on farms and dairies, roughly $30 million annually, to address some of the contamination caused by fertilizers and other chemicals. Because it includes new taxes, the proposal will need a two-thirds vote in each house to pass, which supporters concede will be a battle. 
Still, Monning has been able to forge the unusual alliance of farmers and environmental groups, which rarely agree on public policy. He also has the support of at least one Republican lawmaker: Sen. Andy Vidak, a cherry farmer who said his Central Valley district — which includes Hanford, Fresno and Bakersfield — is the epicenter of the drinking-water problem.

Monning, however, argues that the general fund isn’t a reliable funding source and that the proposed tax on households, amounting to roughly $11.40 per year, is negligible. “You’re not going to notice it on your water bill,” he said. 
The bill is now relegated with hundreds of others in the “suspense file” of the Assembly Appropriations Committee. The panel must decide by Sept. 1 to move it to the Assembly floor for a vote. 
Selerina Chavez took a day off from work to drive from the Kern County city of Arvin for the rally. She said she hoped lawmakers would try to fix the problem posing health risks to her family and her neighbors, many of whom are farm workers or living on fixed incomes. 
When she moved from Ventura County more than 20 years ago, she said, it never occurred to her that the water would be unsafe for her family to drink. They drank it for years, she said, before she learned a few years ago that it contained unsafe levels of arsenic. 
“I thought about my children,” she said in Spanish. “How many years have we been drinking this water?” 
In addition to her regular water bill, she spends $40 per week buying drinking water. She also buys water for cooking. 
Now, she said, “I have three water bills.” 
SENATE BILL 623 
What is it?: SB 623, by Sen. Bill Monning, D-Monterey, would generate $2 billion over 15 years for a Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund, which would provide emergency water and longer-term system fixes for hundreds of communities whose tap water doesn’t meet safe drinking-water standards. 
Where would the money come from? The proposal would generate roughly $110 million per year through a 95-cent monthly fee on home water bills as well as taxes on businesses of up to $10 per month. Another $30 million would come from higher fees on agricultural and dairy businesses, industries whose chemicals contribute to the problem of contaminated groundwater. 
Who’s for it?: Who’s against it? The bill is backed by the agriculture and dairy lobbies, as well as by a long list of environmental, social justice and civic groups — an unusual combo. Water districts are against the bill, saying that taxing water users creates a bad precedent and that collecting the money would be burdensome. 
Will it pass?: If the Assembly Appropriations Committee moves the bill to the floor, it needs a two-thirds vote of each house, which is always a challenge. What’s more, Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes has faced intense blow-back for his bipartisan collaboration to extend California’s landmark climate program, called “cap and trade.” But SB 623 does have one Republican co-author: Sen. Andy Vidak, of Hanford.

Our Question of the Week asked readers, “Is safe drinking water fee all wet ? ” 
All need access to safe, affordable water 
I’ve worked alongside families from Arvin, Alpaugh, East Orosi and other communities that have been dealing with unsafe levels of arsenic, nitrate and other contaminants in their tap water for far too long. 
Drinking contaminated water can cause nausea, respiratory illness and even cancer. To avoid getting sick, many families spend their limited resources buying bottled water. 
Some families have to pay as much as 10 percent of their monthly income for drinking water. That is not right. 
California has high standards and we should be able to make sure everyone can afford safe water. Senate Bill 623 would provide vital funding to ensure all Californians have access to safe and affordable drinking water. 
More than 80 organizations from a bipartisan coalition representing environmental, environmental justice, agricultural, health, labor, business and faith interests support Senate Bill 623. 
We urge your support for this historic effort to guarantee a basic human right. 
— Jenny Rempel, Sacramento 
No taxes, fees needed 
1. Do you agree or disagree that higher taxes or fees are needed to provide safe drinking water to all Californians? Disagree. 
2. Should responsibility be shared equally by water customers across the state? No. 
3. Is this a cost that should be added to water bills, or should tax money be spent instead? General Fund revenue from tax money needs to be spent. 
4. Have ratepayers already been asked to pay too much for water? Yes. 
— Michele Sepeda, San Pedro 
Just say no 
Stop falling for these pathetic reasons to raise another tax. If there is a drinking water health issue Gov. Jerry Brown and his band of thieves should morally fix the problem. 
For once, every Californian should say no to SB623. Californians already pay taxes for water, just like anything else. Use these monies for the affected communities. These rural communities should have been part of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California from the inception of the plan. 
It’s time for Californians to turn this state and its governors down, and make them work for us.

116,First water tax proposed to tackle unsafe drinking water in California,Santa Cruz Sentinel,2017-08-24,"SACRAMENTO >> Californians would for the first time pay a tax on drinking water – 95 cents per month – under legislation to fix hundreds of public water systems with unsafe tap water – a problem that’s most pervasive in rural areas with agricultural runoff.
Senate Bill 623 – backed by a strange-bedfellows coalition of the agricultural lobby and environmental groups, but opposed by water districts – would generate $2 billion in the next 15 years to clean up contaminated groundwater and improve faulty water systems and wells.
“My message is short and direct: We are not Flint, Michigan,” said co-author Sen. Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, at a Wednesday rally outside the Capitol, where demonstrators held signs reading “Clean water is not a luxury” and “Water is a human right.”
Ironically, many Californians are more aware of the crisis in Flint – where officials in 2015 told residents about lead contamination in the drinking water, after claiming it was safe to drink – than about the water problems in their home state, said the measure’s author, State Sen. Bill Monning, D-Monterey. He called this “a pivotal time in our state’s history to do the right thing.”
SB 623 has been moving through the Legislature for months, but was amended Monday to include the tax on water for both homes and businesses. It also imposes fees on farms and dairies – roughly $30 million annually – to address some of the contamination caused by fertilizers and other chemicals. Because it includes new fees, the proposal will need a two-thirds vote in each house to pass, which supporters concede will be a battle.
But Monning has forged the unusual alliance of farmers and environmental groups, which rarely agree on public policy. He also has the support of at least one Republican lawmaker: Sen. Andy Vidak, a cherry farmer who said his Central Valley district – which includes Hanford, Fresno and Bakersfield – is the epicenter of the drinking-water problem.
“This is very, very important to my constituents,” he said after the rally, as some of them began chanting on the Capitol steps. “This is one of the most important things in my district.”
But water agencies say taxing drinking water sets a dangerous precedent and that the bill would turn them into state tax collectors. “Water is essential to life – should we tax drinking water? We don’t think so,” said Cindy Tuck, a spokeswoman for the Association of California Water Agencies.
Sue Stephenson, a spokeswoman for the Dublin San Ramon Services District, said she supported the intent of the proposal – potable drinking water for all – but argued that lawmakers should use the money in existing coffers.
“The whole purpose of the general fund is to help take care of disadvantaged communities,” she said. “There’s no reason that they could not also fund communities that need access to drinking water.”
Monning, however, argues that the general fund is too unreliable of a funding source – and that the proposed tax on households, amounting to roughly $11.40 per year, is negligible. “You’re not going to notice it on your water bill,” he said.
The bill is now relegated with hundreds of others in the “suspense file” of the Assembly Appropriations Committee. The panel must decide by Sept. 1 whether to move it to the Assembly floor for a vote.
Selerina Chavez took a day off from work to drive from the Kern County city of Arvin for the rally. She said she hoped lawmakers would try to fix the problem posing health risks to her family and her neighbors, many of whom are farm workers or living on fixed incomes.
When she moved from Ventura County more than 20 years ago, she said, it never occurred to her that the water would be unsafe for her family to drink. They drank it for years, she said, before she learned that it contained unsafe levels of arsenic.
“I thought about my children,” she said in Spanish. “How many years have we been drinking this water?”
In addition to her regular water bill, she spends $40 per week buying drinking water. She also buys water for cooking.
Now, she said, “I have three water bills.”

117,Trees with a probiotic boost clean up a carcinogen,"""Deirdre Lockwood"" (nobody@acs.org)",2017-09-07,"Home > Trees with a probiotic boost clean up a carcinogen Latest NewsWeb Date: September 7, 2017 Trees with a probiotic boost clean up a carcinogen Symbiotic bacteria help poplars strip trichloroethylene from groundwater Poplar trees grow at a test site contaminated with trichloroethylene. The darker, taller rows of trees have been given microbes and are growing faster than the shorter, lighter poplars with no microbes added. Credit: John Freeman/Intrinsyx Technologies Corporation Poplar trees grow at a test site contaminated with trichloroethylene. The darker, taller rows of trees have been given microbes and are growing faster than the shorter, lighter poplars with no microbes added. Credit: John Freeman/Intrinsyx Technologies Corporation 
Planting poplar trees that harbor a secret weapon—pollutant-busting microbes—could help clean up sites contaminated with the carcinogen trichloroethylene, a new study shows ( Environ. Sci. Technol . 2017, DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.7b01504 ). In the first field trial of this approach at a Superfund hazardous waste site, poplar trees boosted by bacteria within their tissues brought groundwater concentrations of TCE to below the maximum contaminant level for drinking water set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
TCE is used as a solvent and degreaser in industrial processes, and was recently declared a human carcinogen . It contaminates the soil or water of more than 1,000 Superfund sites around the U.S. Current methods to remove it from groundwater include sorbing it onto activated carbon or driving the pollutant out of water with a stream of air. But these methods are so expensive, says Sharon L. Doty of the University of Washington, that many site managers choose to monitor and isolate polluted areas instead of cleaning them up. Now she and her colleagues have developed a much cheaper approach. 
Using plants to soak up pollutants—a method called phytoremediation—can remove a variety of contaminants from soil and groundwater. Introducing symbiotic, pollutant-destroying bacteria to the plants has shown even more promise in lab tests, because carrying the bacteria seems to help plants stay healthier during the process and remove more pollutants. But so far, this probiotic approach has had mixed results in the field, sometimes because the introduced bacteria are outcompeted by naturally present soil microbes. 
Several years ago, Doty and her colleagues discovered symbiotic bacteria in a hybrid poplar ( Populus deltoides crossed with Populus nigra ) that completely break down TCE into chloride ions and carbon dioxide ( Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2012, DOI: 10.1128/AEM.06852-11 ). The researchers found that they could successfully inoculate other poplar trees with the bacteria, a strain of Enterobacter , by soaking tree cuttings in a solution containing the microbe. The microbes colonize the plants after about a week by entering through the roots. 
Poplars are especially good phytoremediators because they grow fast, have deep roots, and drink lots of water: Full-grown trees can transpire hundreds of gallons a day. So, in collaboration with several environmental engineering firms, the researchers decided to test poplar trees inoculated with the microbe at three Superfund sites contaminated with TCE in California’s Silicon Valley. 
They planted four plots of about 100 poplar trees each, half treated with the microbe, and half with a control solution. Over three years, they tracked the trees’ growth and took core samples to measure TCE and some of its metabolites. At the end of the experiment, they measured groundwater concentrations of TCE upstream and downstream of the trees. 
TCE concentrations upstream of the trees were about 300 µg/L, whereas downstream they were below EPA’s drinking water limit of 5 µg/L. Concentrations of other degradation products of TCE were also reduced downstream. The poplars treated with the microbe grew faster than the control trees, with a visible size difference after three years. Inoculated trees also had significantly lower concentrations of TCE. “It’s a really simple way to get rid of an important carcinogen,” Doty says. 
Om Parkash Dhanker , an expert in phytoremediation at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, says it’s exciting that Doty’s team has shown that the method works in the real world. “This is a very cheap and green, clean technology,” he says. Since TCE doesn’t substantially accumulate in the trees, he adds, the wood could possibly be harvested for lumber or other uses. Also, the trees are not genetically modified like some other candidates for phytoremediation, which avoids issues with regulation and public concern, he says. 
Doty says the team already has seen great interest in the technology. “Major companies that have purchased land contaminated with TCE are excited to use it to clean up the sites,” she says.",['Poplar'],acs.org
118,Phase III Data Showed That Venclexta Plus Rituxan Helped People With Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Live Longer Without Their Disease Worsening Compared to Bendamustine Plus Rituxan,http://www.businesswire.com/,2017-09-18,"SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.- Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), announced today that the Phase III MURANO study, which evaluated Venclexta ™ (venetoclax) in combination with Rituxan ® (rituximab) in people with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in the time people lived without their disease progressing (progression-free survival [PFS] as assessed by investigator) when treated with Venclexta plus Rituxan compared to bendamustine plus Rituxan. No new safety signals or increase in known toxicities of Venclexta were observed with the treatment combination of Venclexta plus Rituxan. Venclexta is being developed by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. It is jointly commercialized by the companies in the United States and commercialized by AbbVie outside of the United States. 

“Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is considered incurable and becomes harder to treat with each relapse,” said Sandra Horning, M.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “This is the first study to show that Venclexta plus Rituxan can help people with this type of leukemia live significantly longer without their disease worsening compared to a standard-of-care regimen. We will work with health authorities to bring this potential chemotherapy-free treatment option to the people who need it as quickly as possible.” 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Venclexta in combination with Rituxan for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL based on promising results from the Phase Ib M13-365 study. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of medicines with early evidence of potential clinical benefit in serious or life-threatening diseases and to help ensure that patients receive access to medicines as soon as possible. 
Venclexta was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in April 2016 for the treatment of people with CLL with 17p deletion, as detected by an FDA approved test, who have received at least one prior therapy. The MURANO study is part of the company’s commitment in the United States to convert the current accelerated approval of Venclexta to a full approval. Data from the MURANO study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to global health authorities. 
About the MURANO study 
MURANO (NCT02005471) is a Phase III open-label, international, multicenter, randomized study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Venclexta in combination with Rituxan compared with bendamustine in combination with Rituxan. All treatments were of fixed duration. The study included 389 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL who had been previously treated with at least one but not more than three lines of therapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Venclexta plus Rituxan (Arm A) or bendamustine plus Rituxan (Arm B). The primary endpoint of the study is investigator-assessed PFS. Secondary endpoints include PFS assessed by independent review committee (IRC), best overall response, complete response, duration of response, overall survival, event-free survival, time to next CLL treatment and minimal residual disease (MRD) status. 
About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) 
CLL is the most common type of adult leukemia, and in 2017, it is estimated there will be more than 20,000 new cases of CLL diagnosed in the United States. Although signs of CLL may disappear for a period of time after initial treatment, the disease is considered incurable and many people will require additional treatment due to the return of cancerous cells. 
About Venclexta 
Venclexta is a small molecule designed to selectively bind and inhibit the BCL-2 protein, which plays an important role in a process called apoptosis (programmed cell death). Overexpression of the BCL-2 protein in CLL has been associated with resistance to certain therapies. It is believed that blocking BCL-2 may restore the signaling system that tells cells, including cancer cells, to self-destruct. Venclexta is being developed by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. It is jointly commercialized by the companies in the United States and commercialized by AbbVie outside of the United States. 
Together, the companies are committed to further research with Venclexta, which is currently being evaluated in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of CLL, along with studies in several other types of cancers. In the United States, Venclexta has been granted four breakthrough therapy designations by the FDA: in combination with Rituxan for people with relapsed or refractory CLL; as a monotherapy for people with relapsed or refractory CLL with 17p deletion; in combination with hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine) for people with untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) ineligible for intensive chemotherapy; and in combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) for people with untreated AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. 
Venclexta Indication 
Venclexta ™ (venetoclax) is a prescription medicine used to treat people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with 17p deletion who have received at least one prior treatment. 
Venclexta was approved based on response rate. There is an ongoing study to find out how Venclexta works over a longer period of time. 
It is not known if Venclexta is safe and effective in children. 
Important Safety Information 
Patients must tell their doctor right away about any side effects they experience. 
Venclexta can cause serious side effects, including tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. TLS can cause kidney failure, the need for dialysis treatment, and may lead to death. A patient’s doctor will do tests for TLS. It is important for patients taking Venclexta to keep their appointments for blood tests. Patients will receive other medicines before starting and during treatment with Venclexta to help reduce their risk of TLS. Patients may also need to receive intravenous (IV) fluids into their vein. Patients taking Venclexta should tell their doctor right away if they have any symptoms of TLS during treatment with Venclexta, including fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, confusion, shortness of breath, seizures, irregular heartbeat, dark or cloudy urine, unusual tiredness or muscle pain or joint pain. 
Patients should drink plenty of water when taking Venclexta to help reduce the risk of getting TLS. Patients should drink 6 to 8 glasses (about 56 ounces total) of water each day, starting 2 days before their first dose, on the day of their first dose of Venclexta, and each time the dose is increased. 
Certain medicines must not be taken when patients first start taking Venclexta and while their dose is being slowly increased. 
Patients should tell their doctor about all the medicines they take , including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Venclexta and other medicines may affect each other, causing serious side effects. Patients should not start new medicines during treatment with Venclexta without first talking with their doctor. Before taking Venclexta, patients should tell their doctor about all of their medical conditions, including if they: 
Have any kidney or liver problems. Have problems with their body salts or electrolytes, such as potassium, phosphorus, or calcium. Have a history of high uric acid levels in their blood or gout. Are scheduled to receive a vaccine. Patients should not receive a “live vaccine” before, during, or after treatment with Venclexta, until their doctor tells them it is okay. If a patient is unsure about the type of immunization or vaccine, they should ask their doctor. These vaccines may not be safe or may not work as well during treatment with Venclexta. Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Venclexta may harm an unborn baby. If a patient is able to become pregnant, the doctor should do a pregnancy test before they start treatment with Venclexta, and they should use effective birth control during treatment and for 30 days after the last dose of Venclexta. Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if Venclexta passes into breast milk. Patients should not breastfeed during treatment with Venclexta. Patients taking Venclexta should not drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit, Seville oranges (often used in marmalades), or starfruit while they are taking Venclexta. These products may increase the amount of Venclexta in the patient’s blood. 
Venclexta can cause serious side effects, including: 
Low White Blood Cell Count (neutropenia): Low white blood cell counts are common with Venclexta, but can also be severe. A doctor will do blood tests to check a patient’s blood counts during treatment with Venclexta. Patients should tell their doctor right away if they have a fever or any signs of an infection. The most common side effects of Venclexta include low white blood cell count, diarrhea, nausea, low red blood cell count, upper respiratory tract infection, low platelet count, and feeling tired. 
Venclexta may cause fertility problems in males. This may affect the ability to father a child. Patients should talk to their doctor if they have concerns about fertility. 
These are not all the possible side effects of Venclexta. Patients should tell their doctor if they have any side effect that bothers them or that does not go away. 
Report side effects to the FDA at (800) FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/medwatch . Patients and caregivers may also report side effects to Genentech at (888) 835-2555.

120,Growing Clean Cannabis to Pass California's New Rules,John Geluardi,2017-09-20,"click to enlarge Photo courtesy of Joseph Snow 
As California's newly legalized cannabis market gears up for its January launch, pot farmers are looking for ways to meet new safety standards for their harvests. And in the rush to employ safe farming practices that result in high-quality yields, one California grower has adapted the farming philosophy of Masanobu Fukuoka, an iconoclastic Japanese farmer who bucked the chemical-based farming practices of the early 20th century, and has been producing top-quality cannabis that requires no pesticides, fungicides, or chemical fertilizers and naturally repels molds and insects. 
Joseph Snow, who grows at an undisclosed Bay Area location, is still in the experimental phase but has nonetheless been growing small, indoor crops of cannabis that have been passing laboratory tests with no sign of pesticides and impressively low levels of molds and fungi. Moreover, Snow's grows have been producing average-size yields of highly potent cannabis. 
During a chat last week, the 28-year-old Snow folded his 6-foot-5-inch frame into a chair at Au Coquelet Cafe & Restaurant in Berkeley. He was born in New York but was mostly raised and educated in Israel. And when he talks about the principles of growing cannabis, he becomes quite passionate. ""I'm not in this for a hippie-dippy notion of growing organic plants,"" said Snow. ""That is the goal, of course, but I'm really in it for the science."" 
Earlier this month, the California Bureau of Cannabis Control released a nearly 500-page tome of proposed regulations that will set standards for everything from licensing for growers and dispensaries to acceptable noise levels for outdoor growing activities. Under this extensive oversight, each individual cannabis plant will be ""tracked and traced"" from ""seed to sale"" with particular attention paid to the presence of contamination levels on plants bound for the marketplace. Using sophisticated testing methods, state-certified laboratories will test cannabis products to ensure they meet minimum levels of pesticides, solvents, fungus, and mold. 
This testing took on some urgency recently after Anresco Laboratories conducted tests on all of the cannabis featured at the HempCon Festival held in San Francisco in August. The San Francisco-based laboratory discovered that 80 percent of the cannabis at the festival was contaminated with unhealthy levels of solvents, pesticides, molds, fungus, or various bacteria. 
In addition, research data compiled by Integral Ecology Research Center show that Humboldt, Mendocino, and Kern counties have elevated levels of chemicals often used in banned pesticides. Chemicals such as carbofuran, diazinon, and zinc phosphide, all of which are dangerous to human health, have been found in creeks and rivers that feed into sources of drinking water. Perhaps most alarming, earlier this year a California man undergoing cancer treatment at UC Davis died from a lung infection that doctors believe was caused my ingesting marijuana tainted with fungus. 
Kyle Borland, a cannabis spokesperson with Anresco Laboratories, said they applied the state of Oregon's official standards when testing the HempCon cannabis. ""Admittedly, the man who died had a weak immune system from his cancer treatment, but we took a strict approach to testing the HempCon cannabis, because we want to be assured that medically compromised users will not be at risk,"" Borland said. ""We ran tests on the HempCon cannabis twice, and the vast majority of it would not have been allowed into the Oregon marketplace."" 
Snow is one of many California growers who is applying reliable methods to grow top-quality cannabis that's safe for the newly legal marketplace. But Snow's methodology is largely unknown in the state. And despite facing a host of doubters, he's had a great deal of success and has a stack of test results from Pure Analytics Laboratory in Santa Rosa that shows he's on the right track. Snow said his techniques can be easily adopted by growers who want to produce cannabis that is essentially organic: free from chemical contaminants. ""That's really the goal,"" Snow said. ""Growing outdoors will produce even better and safer product."" 
Snow based his growing theory on Masanobu's book, One-Straw Revolution , which has inspired a natural-farming philosophy internationally. Masanobu's theories have been successfully applied to growing fruits and vegetables, but they have not been widely applied to cannabis cultivation. ""There is very little information about Masanobu's theories in relation to cannabis growth,"" Snow said. ""That's why this method is so revolutionary."" 
The principles are basic: a good environment in terms of healthy, chemical-free soil is required, good lighting (outdoors is best), moderate temperature control, and lots of worms. ""A good combination of red worms and European night crawlers in the mulch seems to work best,"" said Snow, adding that his mulch is simple as well: rice straw and untreated plant material from previous grows. 
""Hard work and careful attention to the plants is mandatory, but if those simple things are provided for the plant, it will naturally produce healthy amounts of resin and terpenes, which effectively protect the plant from mold and fungi,"" Snow said. ""It's the growers who neglect their plants that find themselves in trouble that have to spray their crops with dangerous amounts of chemical herbicides and pesticides. "" 
Snow's methodology sounds very similar to biodynamics, an organic method that dates back to the 1920s. Snow said his theory, which he calls ""Natural Farming,"" is within the rubric of biodynamics, except his practices are greatly simplified. For example, Snow does not compost his soil or use any nutrients as some biodynamic methods call for. And Snow avoids any practices that call for celestial calendars or moon charts, which are common in biodynamics. ""I pare down everything to its most simple,"" Snow said. ""I want to remove anything that is unnecessary and still grow top-quality crops."" 
Reggi Gaudino, vice president of scientific operations at Steep Hill Labs in Berkeley, said good test results for chemicals and mold are not unusual with small grows, but with larger grows, it's much tougher to achieve good outcomes. ""Once you scale up, it becomes harder to avoid microbe contamination,"" Gaudino said. 
Snow agreed that larger grows require more work but said it is possible to grow high-quality plants with virtually no pesticides or other chemicals provided the grower does not get greedy and hires the people needed to properly care for the plants and their environment. 
""There have been a lot of people who doubt the methodology I'm using, but they produce excellent results, and I'm happy to show it to anyone whose interested,"" Snow said. 
Snow said he is unsure when he will move his farm outdoors, though he's looking forward to growing with sunlight. ""It will take longer to harvest, but the best place to grow is the most natural place and that means outside.""

121,Can California Ban Fracking?,,2017-10-04,"This story is being co-published with Capital & Main as part of a series on California Game Changers : Nine Big Ideas That Could Transform the State and Nation.
If you were to parachute into Kern County about 40 miles west of Bakersfield, you might doubt California’s status as a national leader on climate. Pumpjacks spread out in every direction across a hellscape scraped bare of anything green. Scattered at irregular intervals, spires of latticed steel reach up more than a hundred feet, secured with guywires: evidence of hydraulic fracturing, a practice sufficiently infamous that its household nickname, fracking, invokes images of tap water so toxic you can light it on fire.
Fracked oil wells are everywhere on this southeastern extreme of the San Joaquin Valley, hard by the leeward side of the San Andreas fault. Big oil companies such as Chevron and Mobil began hydraulically fracturing wells here in earnest during the late 1970s, after the OPEC embargo made oil expensive and scarce. Drillers learned that by injecting a powerful slurry of chemical-laden water and sand into sedimentary rock, they could blast under played-out conventional wells and squeeze out oil left trapped in fissures, or could access reserves that traditional drilling otherwise couldn’t. (They could also inject acid into a certain kind of petroleum-bearing rock to dissolve it, another “well stimulation” method less common, but just as controversial, as hydraulic fracturing.)
Environmentalists and community activists have long lobbied for a statewide ban on fracking, arguing that the unique chemical cocktails that make up fracking fluids present novel risks to human health. “Given what we know about fracking’s dangers, [banning it] is just a no-brainer,” says Hollin Kretzmann, a staff attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity. But up until two year ago, no one but the drillers even knew where fracking was happening.
Pump jacks are pictured in an oil field over the Monterey Shale formation near Lost Hills, California. Photo: Getty Images/DAVID MCNEW “We didn’t know how much water was being used, which chemicals they were using, even where it was happening — it was a big data vacuum,” says Briana Mordick, senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. That changed with the 2013 passage of Senate Bill 4, then-State Senator Fran Pavley’s well stimulation disclosure act. Now, you can look up fracked wells on a map maintained by the California Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources.
You can also look up what each company puts in its fracking fluids, which may or may not be meaningful. “Two-thirds of the chemicals used in fracking don’t have any public health profiles,” Mordick says. No one has yet done the studies to prove what dangers the chemicals pose. We might know that a common component of acidizing, hydrofluoric acid, eats away at your bones (one drop on your finger and you cut it off or die). But we don’t know whether any chemical escaped into the environment and directly made anyone sick.
Other industries have more established connections to Kern County’s elevated rates of lung disorders and heart disease . Poverty takes a toll on health, as do pesticides from farm fields and exhaust from two major freeways and a railroad. “We are the heart of California,” says Juan Flores, a 31-year-old community organizer with the Center on Race, Poverty & the Environment, in Delano, a mostly agricultural city about half an hour north of Bakersfield. “If something gets moved from north to south in this state, it goes through here.”
Flores figures that each of the county’s principal industries — oil, agriculture and goods movement — account for about a third of the valley’s pollution. Fracking is responsible for only about a fifth of oil’s contribution. Still, he believes a fracking ban is worth fighting for, if only because fracturing encourages wells to be drilled where there were none before. And even if fracking’s precise environmental damage remains somewhat of a mystery in California, the destruction wrought by oil and gas operations does not.
A recent study in rural Colorado found that children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were three to four times more likely to live in close proximity to an oil or gas site. Oil drilling in Los Angeles, which happens in dense, urban neighborhoods, has been associated with asthma, heart disease and low-birthweight babies, primarily because it exacerbates air pollution. Close to 300,000 people in Kern County reside within a mile of an oil well, the majority of them Latino and living near or below the federal poverty line. Hydraulic fracturing makes more oil possible.
Flores is a tall, imposing presence. He grew up in Mexicali and came to the U.S. as a teenager with his parents, both of whom are farmworkers. Despite spending four years as an anti-fracking activist, he seems relentlessly cheerful, even when discussing painful subjects. I ask whether he believes what oil company representatives have told me, all speaking on background: That the oil industry in California is subject to the strictest environmental rules in the nation. “The good part is that I do believe that,” he says. “The bad part is, if we’re dying in California, with the best of the best — I can only imagine the suffering they’re going through in Kansas, in North Dakota, in Texas. To kill the environment where people live,” he says, “that is the worst thing you can do.”
Fracking activity in the San Joaquin Valley slowed temporarily after SB 4’s rules took effect in 2015, says Kyle Ferrar, who monitors the Western U.S. for the FracTracker Alliance, a nonprofit that collects data and other information on fracking in the U.S. Besides disclosure, the law requires strict groundwater monitoring unless drillers obtain exemptions. “When those rules were passed, they were pretty strict, and rightfully so,” Ferrar says. Now permitting has picked up again, and thousands more wells have been stimulated since 2016.
Flores worries the upward trend could continue, especially as older fields age and if oil prices rise. When we spoke, the Bureau of Land Management had signaled an intent to open up more of California’s public lands to oil and gas exploration. A few weeks later, a federal judge struck down that plan, on the grounds that the agency failed to fully investigate the dangers of hydraulic fracturing, which could affect as many as a quarter of the new wells.

Photo: Ty Wright/Bloomberg via Getty Images The administration still has options to pursue; the BLM could well come back with a revised plan sometime in the next four years and prevail. Flores hopes that before that happens, the California legislature will impose a statewide ban, despite the extent to which oil irrigates California politics. (Oil and gas interests donated $2.8 million to campaigns in the November 8, 2016 election. Close to 48 percent of those contributions went to Democrats.) In the meantime, he says, “we’re expecting and hoping is that [local lawmakers] will upgrade their county and city oil and gas ordinances, focusing on the health of the community,” he says. “[Then] the oil industry would not be so attracted to [these] communities to extract oil.”
Last year Monterey County voters did just that, bucking oil’s well-funded opposition to approve Measure Z, prohibiting fracking and other well-stimulation methods within the county’s boundaries. And unlike some other California counties that have passed similar laws — Santa Cruz, San Benito, Alameda, Butte and Mendocino — Monterey County actually has oil: More than 1,000 wells operate on four fields near San Ardo, in the Salinas Valley. Chevron and Aera Energy almost immediately filed suits to stop the law from being implemented, and public hearings over exemptions and timelines have been contentious.
Lawsuit or not, Hollin Kretzmann contends that Measure Z is a model for other jurisdictions that want to take action at a local level. “New York’s fracking ban started with a couple of rural townships,” he points out. “It spread to a dozen townships. The governor was under enormous pressure from the public, and facing the science was forced to [sign] a statewide ban.”
“The oil companies, they’re going to be left behind,” Juan Flores says, standing in the shade of an abundant valley oak in Panorama Park, an expanse of manicured grass on Bakersfield’s bluffs. The view from the bluffs is both breathtaking and dissonant: Looking down, you can see the lush green of the Kern River Valley; along the horizon a field of black pumpjacks, planted over scoured and parched brown earth, extend into apparent infinity. Flores traces with his finger the route of a canal that carries water left over from Chevron’s Kern River operations. Eventually, that water mixes with fresh water in an irrigation canal. During the drought of the last six years, farmers used it to keep their nut groves green. “Think about that,” Flores says, “when you eat your almonds and pistachios.”
It’s clear that Bakersfield’s boosters still take pride in this landscape. You don’t name bluffs, a park and a scenic drive “Panorama” because you’re ashamed of the view. But Flores notes that some of the field’s pumps have gone idle. Since oil-prices crashed from their well-over $100-a-barrel highs to under $50 a barrel in 2015, Kern County’s economy has struggled.
“I notice the anger, the frustration of the oil workers who have lost jobs,” he says. “I know it makes it worse for them seeing me in documentaries saying ‘Yeah, I really want fracking to stop.’ But what I want them to notice is that oil is not everything. They can jump on this train of renewable energy and be the leaders of it.”
He imagines another future for Bakersfield’s windy, sun-baked vista: Hundreds and thousands of solar panels and wind turbines, generating clean power for California’s grid. “Even more than that, I can see community members owning that energy, being part of it,” he says. “We’ll be so much better off with energy that won’t hurt us.”

122,Comment submitted by C. Clary,anonymous,2017-10-04,"Sep 8, 2017 Dear Administrator Pruitt and Deputy Assistant Secretary Lamont, Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Docket Number EPA-HQ-OW-2017-0203-0001, which repeals the 2015 Clean Water Rule. I'm a sportsman and I strongly oppose repealing the Clean Water Rule. Finalized in 2015, the Rule clarifies that the Clean Water Act protects 20 million acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of headwater streams -- 60% of the country's flowing waters. These waters shield communities from flooding, supply drinking water to one in three Americans, and provide essential fish and wildlife habitat that supports a robust outdoor recreation economy worth $887 billion annually. The hunting and fishing industries in the United States directly employ 483,000 Americans. The Clean Water Rule is firmly grounded in science. In developing the rule, EPA analyzed more than 1,200 peer-reviewed and other studies that assessed connections between small streams, non-tidal wetlands, and other upstream waters on larger downstream waters, including lakes, rivers, and estuaries. That review demonstrated the significant physical, chemical and biological connections between wetlands and headwaters streams to larger rivers. To balance the need to protect our nation's waters with the interests of those whose activities affect water quality, the Rule also explicitly excludes some waters, like puddles and most roadside ditches, from regulation. The agencies also preserved existing exemptions for categories of activities like normal farming and ranching practices. I live in Lake County, California. Home to Clear Lake, the largest natural freshwater lake wholly within the state, with 68 square miles (180 km2) of surface area. Lakes have existed at the site for at least 2,500,000 years, possibly making it the oldest lake in North America. The lake is heavily contaminated with mercury from the nearby Sulphur Bank Mercury Mine. The abandoned mine was declared a Superfund site in the early 1990s and is still undergoing clean-up. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife presently recommends that women of childbearing age and children do not consume certain fish from Clear Lake, due to the presence of methylmercury compounds in lake sediments. This affects all species health (including humans) the local economy and our wetlands. We need to focus major attention, resources, and increased environmental and economic intervention on this watershed. Status quo is not fast enough. I believe that repealing the Clean Water Rule and codifying the status quo will lead to uncertainty for States, federal and states water quality personnel, those who need permits and the public. In the last ten years, the ""status quo"" has hurt the efforts of sportsmen and women to protect water resources; contributed to permit delays; and left Corps water quality personnel spending large amounts of time trying to decide which waters the Clean Water Act protects. The Corps will now continue to make permitting decisions on a case-by-case basis indefinitely, and as a result, it will cause uncertainty for all involved in permitting. In addition, the 2008 guidance document that the Corps is using as the ""status quo"" to decide jurisdiction was not based on publicly available scientific, technical, or economic analyses, and it was never published in the Federal Register for public comment. This document is no substitute for a properly-issued rule. To justify the repeal, the agencies rely on a seriously flawed economic analysis. To arrive at a net benefit justifying repeal of the 2015 Rule, the agencies removed the estimated $306 billion in annual benefits that would result from the 2015 Rule protecting wetlands. The agencies have said Americans may value streams and wetlands less than they did in 2014, but they don't give any reason why the public would value clean water less than they did before. As a sportsman, I value clean water and I support conserving our wetlands and small streams. Repealing the Clean Water Rule is a huge step backward in achieving the goal of the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the nation's waters. I believe in the goal of the Clean Water Act and I respectfully ask that you protect the streams and wetlands so important to hunters and anglers. Thank you, Ms. Christie Clary CA 95458",['Lamont'],regulations.gov
123,Fracking Fracas: BLM to Open California Public Lands,Jerri-Lynn Scofield,2018-08-09,"by Jerri-Lynn Scofield
By Jerri-Lynn Scofield, who has worked as a securities lawyer and a derivatives trader. She is currently writing a book about textile artisans.
The US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) took initial steps yesterday to open 1.6 million acres of California public lands to fracking and conventional oil drilling, ending a five-year moratorium on such practices in the state.
In its Notice of Intent , the BLM announced it will analyze the impact of fracking thought the state and will prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement and a potential Resource Management Plan. The BLM has solicited public comments according to a tight schedule; the comment period closes on September 7, 2018.
The Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) noted in a press release, Trump Administration Moves to Reopen California Public Lands to Oil Leasing that the notice covers 400,000 acres of public land and an additional 1.2 million acres of federal mineral estate, located in Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Tulare, and Ventura counties. It also provided background on thecurrent moratorium:
In 2015 the Center for Biological Diversity and Los Padres ForestWatch, represented by Earthjustice, successfully sued the BLM for approving a resource management plan allowing oil and gas drilling and fracking on vast stretches of California’s public lands without adequately analyzing and disclosing the impacts of fracking on air quality, water and wildlife.
As a result of the groups’ legal victory, the BLM agreed to complete a new analysis of the pollution risks of fracking before deciding whether to allow drilling and fracking on public land across California’s Central Valley, the southern Sierra Nevada and in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties.
The BLM has not held a single lease sale in California since 2013 when a federal judge first ruled that the agency had violated the National Environmental Policy Act by issuing oil leases in Monterey County without considering the environmental dangers of fracking.
In BLM kicks off review of Calif. fracking impacts , Energy Wire discussed what followed from the US district court for the central district of California’s 2016 ruling in this action and its wider significance:
The parties then reached a settlement in May 2017 in which BLM agreed to suspend new leasing while conducting additional fracking analysis. The agency has continued to issue drilling permits on existing leases ( Energywire , May 4, 2017).
The court ruling and subsequent settlement were big wins for critics of fracking and other modern oil and gas technology. Environmentalists have frequently used litigation to push BLM to study potential impacts, but courts have only sided with the groups in a few cases. In another landmark case, a judge in Northern California ordered BLM to take a closer look during the leasing stage at risks associated with fracking.
Fracking Controversial in California
The Sacramento Bee reported in Trump administration moves to open 1.6 million acres to fracking, drilling in California that county supervisors in San Luis Obispo have placed a measure on the November ballot that would ban new oil exploration and new fracking operations in unincorporated regions of the county:
The measure’s leading proponent, Charles Varni of the Coalition to Protect San Luis Obispo County, said he was angered to hear of the Bureau of Land Management’s decision, which would affect pockets of land throughout the county but primarily in the eastern and northwestern areas.
“We don’t want to see any expansion of oil and gas extraction in San Luis Obispo County,” he said. “We want to protect our groundwater resources for higher uses.”
The CBD further emphasized:
A 2015 report from the California Council on Science and Technology concluded that fracking in California happens at unusually shallow depths, dangerously close to underground drinking water supplies, with unusually high concentrations of chemicals, including substances dangerous to human health and the environment.
The Sacramento Bee reported that environmentalists have asked Governor Jerry Brown to ban the practice, citing the potential to contaminate groundwater and increase earthquake risks, while the energy industry applauded yesterday’s BLM move:
Kara Siepmann of the Western States Petroleum Association , the leading oil lobby in California, said the association is “supportive of BLM beginning the comprehensive evaluation and scoping process of federal lands in California.” Rock Zierman of the California Independent Petroleum Association, whose members include smaller oil companies, said expanded production could reduce the state’s growing dependence on imported oil.
Although Brown has allowed fracking to continue, the Legislature has passed a law that requires energy producers to get additional permitting if they practice fracking. And earlier this year, when the Trump administration began the process of repealing all federal regulations of fracking, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued the administration.
The Hill reported in Trump officials open door to fracking in California that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has consistently endorsed increasing drilling on public lands in order to increase lease sales.
Environmentalists will monitor the BLM’s next steps closely, with CBD senior attorney Clair Lakewood saying, “ her organization will be waiting to see how the administration justifies fracking in their analysis, ” according to The Hill:
“You can’t justify drilling for fossil fuels anymore, there is no way to come out with an environmental analysis and find out this is OK,” she said.
Lakewood said the timing on the notice of intent was also particularly striking. At the end of July, the administration announced it would be weakening Obama-era standards on vehicle emissions standards, a move that would take away California’s ability to set its own heightened regulations.
[Jerri-Lynn here: See this previous post for more on the conflict between Trump regulators and California on emissions standards, Trump Regulators and California on Collision Course on Rolling Back Fuel Efficiency Standards .]
Unsurprisingly, Trump has his own unique take on the situation. , . You cannot fault the man for not having views on any and all topics (whether they’re logical or well-considered, however…). From The Hill:
Recently, President Trump has criticized the Golden State over environmental standards he has deemed too strict. This week, he sent a series of tweets blaming the state’s policies on water and logging for the number of wildfires raging within its borders.
Allrighty then. I guess climate change has nothing to do with the infernos. Trump couldn’t possibly be wrong on such a matter of vital national interest, could he? Surely not!","['Kern', 'Tulare']",nakedcapitalism.com
124,"Legal Settlement Halts Effort to Open 1 Million Acres in California to Oil Drilling, Fracking | Earthjustice",,2017-05-04,"Legal Settlement Halts Effort to Open 1 Million Acres in California to Oil Drilling, Fracking Victory: Agreement Preserves Moratorium on Leasing Public Lands to Oil Industry 
An oil pumpjack towers above almond orchards in Shafter, Calif., a small city in Kern County. ""Red and White"" by Sarah Craig/Faces of Fracking 
Fracking has no place in California’s clean, renewable energy future Greg Loarie May 4, 2017 Los Angeles —
Conservationists have forced the Trump administration to halt plans to open more than 1 million acres of public land and mineral estate in California to oil drilling and fracking. The victory preserves a four-year-old moratorium on leasing federally owned land in the state for oil and gas development. 
The legal settlement, approved Wednesday, resolves a lawsuit brought by the Center for Biological Diversity and Los Padres ForestWatch, represented by Earthjustice. The agreement requires the Bureau of Land Management to rework a resource-management plan that would have auctioned off drilling rights on vast stretches of public land in California’s Central Valley, the southern Sierra Nevada, and Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties. 
“This is a big victory for California and a major blow to Trump’s plan to turn our public lands over to oil companies,” said Brendan Cummings, the Center’s conservation director. “Despite the petroleum industry’s stranglehold on the White House, these beautiful wild places are still off limits to drilling and fracking. That protects our water, wildlife and climate from fracking pollution.” 
The BLM has not held a single lease sale in California since 2013, when a federal judge first ruled that the agency had violated the National Environmental Policy Act by issuing oil leases in Monterey County without considering the environmental dangers of fracking. The new settlement will continue that de facto leasing moratorium. 
“This agreement ensures that public lands along California’s central coast — and the communities that depend on them — are protected from the harmful effects of oil drilling and fracking,” said ForestWatch Executive Director Jeff Kuyper. “Our region’s wildlife, clean water and scenic landscapes are too valuable to sacrifice to development.” “Our hope is that this settlement puts the final nail in the coffin for BLM’s illegal practice of rubberstamping fracking in California without environmental review,” said Earthjustice attorney Greg Loarie, who represented the groups. “Fracking has no place in California’s clean, renewable energy future.” 
The settlement means that the BLM must now complete a new analysis of the pollution risks of fracking, which blasts toxic chemicals mixed with water underground to crack rocks. 
The public lands at stake in today’s settlement encompass “numerous groundwater systems that contribute to the annual water supply used by neighboring areas for agricultural and urban purposes,” a federal judge noted last year. 
A 2015 report from the California Council on Science and Technology concluded that fracking in California happens at unusually shallow depths, dangerously close to underground drinking water supplies, with unusually high concentrations of chemicals, including substances dangerous to human health and the environment.

CONNECT TWEET 12 LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE As fire raged in Ventura, Calif., earlier this month, Gracie Hartman made her way to the county fairgrounds to look for her friend, Fernando.
She found him there at the evacuation center, among 69 patients from the Vista del Mar acute psychiatric hospital, one of two such facilities in the county. They had been removed with little time to spare as the hospital was overtaken by flames.
Over the next couple of days, Fernando was transferred to one general hospital as a stopgap, then to another, because, unlike the first, it would accept his insurance.
“He was so upset, that he was throwing up,” said Hartman, who spoke on condition that Fernando be identified only by his first name to protect his privacy. “It was a nightmare.”
Overnight, the private hospital’s shutdown wiped out about two-thirds of the psychiatric hospital capacity in Ventura County, population 850,000. That a fire could so quickly devastate a county’s inpatient psychiatric services only underscores how few beds there are — a phenomenon that holds true across California and nationwide.
“It’s a huge loss,” said Dr. Bryan Wong, chief medical officer of the county-run Ventura County Medical Center, which has a 43-bed psychiatric unit. “It leaves us vulnerable. It was a crisis even before the fires. We were at full capacity consistently. Now, it’s turned into a level beyond that.”
There are about 8,805 acute psychiatric beds in California, according to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development — not enough, advocates say, to meet the need. California has about 15 psychiatric beds per 100,000 residents compared with a recommended standard of 50 beds for 100,000 people, according to the Arlington, Va.-based Treatment Advocacy Center, which promotes greater access to mental health treatment.
The country has struggled with a national shortage of psychiatric hospital beds for many years. Last year, the United States had 37,679 state psychiatric beds, down 13% from 2010, according to the center.
The closure of public psychiatric hospitals has left many people with nowhere to go for treatment during an acute mental health crisis, according to the Virginia-based center. Without a reliable source of inpatient care, patients languish in overcrowded emergency rooms or, even worse, deteriorate until they’re arrested and jailed, often for minor infractions. Some become homeless.

126,Should a new tax help pay for safe drinking water? Yes,"Tim Johnson 
Special to The Bee",2017-08-19,"Order Reprint of this Story August 18, 2017 5:48 PM 
If there’s one thing a farmer knows, it’s the importance of water. Access to clean, safe drinking water ought to be a fundamental right for all Californians. 
But there are about 300 unsafe drinking-water systems across the state, many of them in the Salinas Valley or in the Central Valley’s Tulare Lake Basin. These 1 million Californians getting water from these systems must buy or obtain drinking water in jugs or bottles. Opinion 
That is why the California Rice Commission, the Western Growers Association and other agriculture industry leaders have stepped up to support a balanced, sustainable solution to this unacceptable public health problem, which is greater in scope than the well-chronicled crisis in Flint, Mich. 
Senate Bill 623 by Sen. Bill Monning, D-Carmel, would create a Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund to provide emergency relief and also fund water-treatment facilities that these small water systems cannot possible afford on their own. 
Funding would come from two sources. Because in many cases the water is contaminated by nitrates, an unavoidable byproduct of farming operations, a growing number of agricultural industry leaders are supporting a small fee to cover nitrate-related costs. The bill would also provide regulatory certainty for farmers while they continue to reduce the impact of fertilizers on groundwater. 
Also contributing to the problem are other contaminants, such as arsenic and perchlorate, that are not related to agricultural operations. It is a statewide problem, so the legislation includes a statewide solution – a modest fee of less than $1 a month on the water bills for residents and businesses. Low-income households would be exempted. 
This approach is similar to basic services as electricity; all customers pay a small fee to ensure that low-income families have access to a necessity. These water systems serve small, mostly rural communities of mostly low-income families who can’t afford to buy water, on top of paying their water bill. Some families are spending up to 10 percent of their incomes on drinking water. 
It is a third-world problem that cannot be tolerated in a state as prosperous and proud as California. It’s long past time that the Legislature, working with state and local water agencies and rural communities, produced a sustainable solution. Such a solution is at hand, and it is a bipartisan plan supported not just by farm groups, but also environmental groups such as Clean Water Action and health groups such as the American Heart Association. 
The fact that 1 million Californians cannot use water from their taps to mix baby formula, make iced tea, brush their teeth or simply quench their thirst ought to be unacceptable. It is a problem we are morally compelled to solve.",['Tulare'],modbee.com
127,Comment on Climate Panic: Trump’s Justice Kennedy Replacement Might Repeal the EPA’s Right to Regulate CO2 by MarkG,MarkG,2018-07-01,"Robert Kernodle

The Clean Air Act actually only authorizes:
“The Administrator shall by regulation prescribe (and from time to time revise) in accordance with the provisions of this section, standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, which in his judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. ”
CO2 was not addressed in the legislation. In Massachusets v EPA , the Court actually ruled:
If the scientific uncertainty is so profound that it precludes EPA from making a reasoned judgment, it must say so. The statutory question is whether sufficient information exists for it to make an endangerment finding. . . .On remand, EPA must ground its reasons for action or inaction in the statute. Pp. 30–32.
The critical issue is whether CO2 will actually “endanger public health or welfare”. That then hinges on whether the EPA will find evidence for Endangerment Finding. EPA analyst Alan Carlin documented how that Endangerment Finding was NOT prepared by objective EPA standards.

Just to make clear what continues to be almost universally misunderstood:
Mass. v. EPA neither “required” nor “gave EPA the right” to regulate CO2, nor declared it a “pollutant.”
CO2 is not even mentioned in the Clean Air Act’s list of pollutants to be regulated. The SCOTUS decision in Mass. v. EPA (2007) said the Clean Air Act would require the agency to regulate CO2 IF the agency concluded that CO2 posed a threat to human health and public safety. A little more than two years later (December 7–yeah, Pearl Harbor Day) in 2009, the Obama EPA issued its “endangerment finding,” deliberately obligating itself to regulate CO2 as a pollutant.
Here is where discarding the endangerment finding — which the SCOTUS cannot simply do on its own volition — gets complicated: The EPA regulating CO2 under the Clean Air Act is what prevents parasitic plaintiff attorneys from suing absolutely anyone who provides or uses fossil fuels and whose pockets are deep enough to make an inviting target, because federal regulation preempts (“displaces”) common-law nuisance suits, as we saw in Connecticut v. AEP [2011]. This was underlined by the wacky reasoning San Francisco and allied plaintiffs were forced to adopt in the suit against Chevron et. al. dismissed last week in California.
Noxious as it is, getting rid of the endangerment finding could open the door to countless — literally countless — nuisance lawsuits. Depending on the venue, some of those lawsuits might succeed in hamstringing lawful commerce and ruining people’s lives.
Overturning the status quo may look tempting but could prove too clever by half. It may be desirable but is not something to be undertaken without thinking through the huge potential for unintended consequences. Vote Up 0 Vote Down Reply June 30, 2018 6:23 pm Lewis P Buckingham
But then if CO2 is found and declared to be fundamentally either benign or beneficial to our way of life, case law would cite that. The ‘endangerment finding’ would be abrogated. CO2 regulation would then default to making sure CO is not produced in dangerous quantities as a by product of burning carbon sources. As well CO2 would remain a gas monitored and regulated in closed spaces such as mines, submarines, tunnels and so forth. So the EPA still regulates CO2. The regulatory power and findings of the EPA would then be normalised and seen as a benchmark against which litigation would be tested. Vote Up 1 Vote Down Reply June 30, 2018 8:57 pm ossqss

Dow Chemical is pushing a Trump administration open to scrapping regulations to ignore the findings of federal scientists who point to a family of widely used pesticides as harmful to about 1,800 critically threatened or endangered species. Lawyers representing Dow, whose CEO is a close adviser to Trump, and two other manufacturers of organophosphates sent letters last week to the heads of three of Trump's Cabinet agencies. The companies asked them ""to set aside"" the results of government studies the companies contend are fundamentally flawed. Bill O'Reilly Ousted At Fox News Channel 
Fox News host Bill O'Reilly was officially pushed out at the network. This comes after O'Reilly had paid out more than $13 million to five different women over allegations of sexual harassment. In a statement, 21st Century Fox said, ""After a thorough and careful review of the allegations, the Company and Bill O’Reilly have agreed that Bill O’Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel."" O'Reilly has denied any wrongdoing. (Published Wednesday, April 19, 2017) Dow Chemical wrote a $1 million check to help underwrite Trump's inaugural festivities, and its chairman and CEO, Andrew Liveris, heads a White House manufacturing working group. The industry's request comes after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced last month he was reversing an Obama-era effort to bar the use of Dow's chlorpyrifos pesticide on food after recent peer-reviewed studies found that even tiny levels of exposure could hinder the development of children's brains. Residents Rattled, Mass. Drops Snake Island Plan In his prior job as Oklahoma's attorney general, Pruitt often aligned himself in legal disputes with the interests of executives and corporations who supported his state campaigns. He filed more than a dozen lawsuits seeking to overturn some of the same regulations he is now charged with enforcing. Pruitt declined to answer questions from reporters Wednesday as he toured a polluted Superfund site in Indiana. A spokesman for the agency later told AP that Pruitt won't ""prejudge"" any potential rule-making decisions as ""we are trying to restore regulatory sanity to EPA's work.""

As with the recent human studies of chlorpyrifos, Dow hired its own scientists to produce a lengthy rebuttal to the government studies. Over the past four years, government scientists have compiled an official record running more than 10,000 pages indicating the three pesticides under review — chlorpyrifos, diazinon and malathion — pose a risk to nearly every endangered species they studied. Regulators at the three federal agencies, which share responsibilities for enforcing the Endangered Species Act, are close to issuing findings expected to result in new limits on how and where the highly toxic pesticides can be used. Millennials' Main Motive?

Similar results were shown for malathion and diazinon. In a statement, the Dow subsidiary that sells chlorpyrifos said its lawyers asked for the EPA's biological assessment to be withdrawn because its ""scientific basis was not reliable.""

A 2012 study at the University of California at Berkeley found that 87 percent of umbilical-cord blood samples tested from newborn babies contained detectable levels of chlorpyrifos. In 2005, the Bush administration ordered an end to residential use of diazinon to kill yard pests such as ants and grub worms after determining that it poses a human health risk, particularly to children. However it is still approved for use by farmers, who spray it on fruits and vegetables. 'We Will Defeat Any Attack': Pence to Crowd in Japan

Aaron Hernandez Dies by Apparent Suicide in Prison ""Endangered species are the canary in the coal mine,"" Hartl said. Since many of the threatened species are aquatic, he said they are often the first to show the effects of long-term chemical contamination in rivers and lakes used as sources of drinking water by humans.

After decades of advocacy and thousands of scientific studies , chlorpyrifos—a pesticide widely used on fruits and vegetables—may finally be headed to the history books. Yesterday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must finalize its proposed ban on chlorpyrifos—a pesticide linked to learning disabilities in children—within 60 days.
The ruling comes in a lawsuit brought by a coalition of labor and health organizations, including NRDC, represented by Earthjustice and joined by 8 state Attorneys General . The decision can be found here .
This decision supports the efforts of pediatricians , public health experts , and farmworker advocates to protect children from a chemical found to contaminate the food supply, drinking water, and the air in agricultural communities. Significant science —including from EPA itself—shows that exposure to low levels of the pesticide in early life can lead to increased risk of learning disabilities, including reductions in IQ, developmental delay and ADHD. Farmworkers—many of whom are Latinx—and their children face additional, disproportionate risk because the chemical is used so close to where they live , work, and go to school —resulting in exposures from air, drinking water, and dust in their homes.
In a 2-1 decision, the Court made three important findings: The Court could, and needed to, step-in because EPA was evading its responsibility to protect children from exposure to a dangerous pesticide. EPA could not delay action to protect children any longer. Since EPA has not shown that chlorpyrifos can be used safely on food, it must enact the ban proposed in 2016.
The Court then directed EPA to “revoke all tolerances and cancel all registrations for chlorpyrifos within 60 days”—which would effectively ban the use of chlorpyrifos in the US and prohibit chlorpyrifos residues on all food sold here.
The Court decision comes on the heels of Congressional efforts to force a ban and state-level efforts to protect their communities. In June, Hawaii became the first state to ban chlorpyrifos and last week, Agency scientists in California finalized a report that found chlorpyrifos use poses unacceptable risks to infants, children, and pregnant women. California’s independent evaluation echoed EPA’s earlier findings: exposure to chlorpyrifos in food, water, and air threatens children’s brain development, especially in California’s farming communities.
Environmentalists, farmworkers, and other public health organizations are calling on Governor Brown and the California Department of Pesticide Regulation to use California’s independent authority to ensure that communities get the protections promised in the Court decision. California uses more chlorpyrifos than any other state in the nation—close to 1 million pounds per year on about 80 crops, including healthy favorites like citrus, nuts, berries, and broccoli. Given EPA’s history of foot-dragging on this issue, the state must be prepared to protect communities.
NRDC will keep fighting alongside communities and public health experts to protect kids over industry profits. As Angel Garcia, Chair of the Tulare County Coalition Advocating for Pesticide Safety said in a statement , “Every day that this pesticide is used puts another family’s child at risk of permanent brain damage and lowered IQ. If the officials who made these decisions lived where we live, they would have already taken action.” About the Authors",['Tulare'],nrdc.org

Recent tests of drinking water from one well in Tulare has registered high levels of trichloropropane, a contaminant that could lead to cancer.

(KFSN) -- The City of Tulare has a problem with its water supply, but city leaders say there's no significant cause for concern, despite a connection to cancer.A letter to residents being sent by the city water division this week says the city has failed a state drinking water standard because the amount of a humanmade chemical linked to cancer and found in the water system exceeded the maximum contaminant level.Of the city's many wells, number 37's running average for 1,2,3-trichloropropane, or TCP, was eight parts per trillion, where the maximum is five parts per trillion.Tulare Public Works Director Trisha Whitfield says people, ""Can still drink our water. We are working towards treatment; we are in compliance with the state.""Six wells spread throughout the city have tested positive for TCP, a chemical used in soil fumigants through the 1980's.All six, according to the city, will receive treatment over the next few years, using granular-activated carbon filter technology. It will be paid for with money the city received in a groundwater settlement. They're also building two large storage tanks and three new wells, which will improve its water system.""Once those three wells are online, we can take the older and the TCP contaminated wells offline, and get those treated and then bring them back online.""Tulare city officials say they're not alone, TCP has also been detected in other California cities. RELATED: Atwater drinking water contaminated with trichloropropane Tulare also says they don't want water customers to be alarmed.

131,Undrinkable water in California’s Central Valley,Donnell Alexander,2018-08-28,"Photo by tico_24 /Flickr/ CC 2.0
CUTLER, CA—Outside a convenience store just down the road from where he recently graduated high school, David Vigil talks to me about how his large extended family must cope with tap water he can’t trust. In this produce-rich and citizen-poor agricultural community, contaminated groundwater comes out of many residents’ faucets.
“We just buy… 24-packs of Crystal Geyser,” Vigil told me. “Every two days we buy a 24-pack, at least.”
Cutler is a 97-percent Latino-farmworker town located at the heart of Central California agricultural bounty. The extra $15 a week the Vigil family spends for bottled water might not seem traumatic at first glance. However, in a part of America where the median family income is a little over $2,000 a month, that $60 expenditure hurts.
The California Water Resources Control Board reports that 360,000 residents lack access to clean drinking water, owing to ground contamination and aged infrastructure.
That’s about three times the population of Flint, Michigan. According to Water Deeply, a nonprofit publication that covers water in the West, an estimated one million Californians —mostly rural and poor—are exposed to contaminated water each year.
“Many of these communities are ‘unincorporated,’ which means they lack a municipal government and the amenities other towns take for granted—streetlights, sidewalks, and sometimes clean drinking water and proper sewage treatment,” reported Water Deeply.
Though Cutler’s water last year met state safety standards for the first time in more than a decade, many families here still choose not to chance it.
A bill that would bring potable water at a reasonable rate to rural places such as Cutler is now making its way through the legislature in Sacramento.
“Water out of our tap should be safe to drink, and we shouldn’t have to fear drinking that water because we fear that we’re going to get sick,” said Susana De Anda, cofounder of the Community Water Center, a nonprofit advocacy and education organization in Visalia. “A lot of Central Valley residents, hardworking families, are exposed to some toxic water, and having to pay some of the highest bills for water they cannot drink, in essence paying for it twice,” she continued.
Californians relying on public water systems that fail to deliver drinkable water are forced to buy the bottled stuff at about $3.50 per case of 24, on top of being taxed for water that, in Cutler’s case, has contained unsafe levels of nitrates and pesticides in recent years. De Anda told me that being billed double is only the most visible aspect of her constituency’s water-related struggles.
“In addition to having to pay the price, money-wise, you’re also having to deal with health impacts, and that’s severe,” she said. “Having to constantly live in a stressful situation, buying bottled water. And making sure you have extra waters in case family comes.” Parents, she added, must monitor their children while brushing their teeth so that they don’t swallow any water.
In 2012, the Community Water Center helped lobby for the passage of a state bill that declared access to safe, clean drinking water a human right.
That declaration amounted to empty words, however. It didn’t decontaminate one drop of the Tulare County water supply.
“That was passed in 2012, and it’s 2018 and that still is not a reality. So we’re in violation of the law,” De Anda pointed out. “The big why is because we lack the resources to [ensure] that all Californians have safe, clean, and affordable drinking water.”
A water purification plant to serve Cutler would cost approximately $2 million, a figure that would wreck the budget of most towns around these parts. It’s one thing to declare water is a human right; it’s another to fix a malfunctioning well. So as part of his final budget, Governor Jerry Brown last winter proposed a fund to provide quick relief. The so-called “Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund” would pay for the development of sustainable water service and infrastructure.
The fund would have been financed by a new tax. But talk in the capitol’s halls was that a certain influential—if imagined—voter would punish supporters of any new tax at the polls in November. By June, the bill appeared to be dying, so its authors recently presented a plan for the fund to come from a voluntary fee instead. California water customers can now opt out of a monthly 95-cent tax. Dairies and fertilizer manufacturers, chiefly responsible for nitrates in groundwater, would be required to chip in as well.
Opponents of tax increases have protested even this watered down version of the proposed law.
“Everybody involved with this is well intended,” said Cindy Tuck, a lobbyist for California’s water agencies, “but there are some that really want the authority to tax water and they’re looking at numbers that are significantly bigger than 95 cents per month.”
Calling the rewritten SB-845 a “new twist on the statewide tax proposal,” Tuck said the fund will lead to unnecessary government bureaucracy if passed. Foes say the bill would impose a costly and complicated program that would require more than 3,000 water systems to solicit and collect donations on customers’ local water bills, then to pass that money to the capitol. Forcing local entities to change billing software and to hire staff to implement the law, said Tuck, would ultimately raise the cost of water.
“We don’t think that makes sense,” she said. “It’s not efficient.”
Pablo Garza, California political director for the ecosystems program at the Environmental Defense Fund, disagrees.
“I don’t know the ins and outs of collecting that fee, but as a homeowner I see all sorts of fees on my property tax bill, on my utility water bills,” Garza said. “There probably is a cost to setting that up, but I don’t know that I agree that it’s inefficient or unwieldy.”
In June, Orange County voters recalled Democratic state senator Josh Newman, who lost his seat because of his support for a gas tax. That sent a shock wave of election day vulnerability across some districts. With so much political attention focused on the repeal of the gas tax, one for water turned into an illogically hard sell. Estimates are that the annual costs of improving water quality would be $140 million per year. The state’s rainy day fund alone is about $13.8 billion.
“In an election year, when one side is running on an anti-tax, anti-fee kind of agenda, it suddenly becomes really complicated or difficult to take this vote,” Garza continued. “You know, everyone will say that this is an embarrassment. I don’t think you will find anyone on either side of the aisle who’ll say that it’s acceptable. The political will just hasn’t been there. I hope that now that’s not the case, but we won’t know for sure until the legislature adjourns.”
