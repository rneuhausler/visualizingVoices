"1,2,3-trichloropropane (1,2,3-TCP) is a man-made carcinogenic chemical that was added unnecessarily to a fumigant used in agriculture for many decades. Humans are exposed through ingestion of contaminated water or even by breathing in contaminated steam. The State of California recognized 1,2,3-TCP as a cancer-causing chemical present in drinking water in 1992, but took no action until Community Water Center and allies advocated for an enforceable standard. Without such a standard, public utilities didn’t have to test for the chemical, filter it out, or even advise their customers if it was in the water. On December 14, 2017, the California Water Resources Control Board adopted a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for 1,2,3-TCP of 5 parts per trillion, the minimum level that this chemical can be detected with current testing technology, known as the detection level. Such a stringent standard reflects the state’s recognition of 1,2,3-TCP’s toxicity.","July 31, 2018","['Tulare', 'Doyle', 'Orange', 'Visalia', 'Sacramento', 'Watsonville', 'Porterville', 'Orosi']","['Tulare', 'Orange', 'Kern', 'Sacramento', 'Kings']",July 2018 eNews - Community Water Center,https://www.communitywatercenter.org/july_2018_enews

Today, the reality for hundreds of communities throughout the state is they have tap water that’s too contaminated to drink and no money to clean it up. Over 300 mostly rural and economically disadvantaged California communities have water that has dangerous levels of arsenic, uranium, or nitrates, which have drastic health implications. The biggest barrier in solving this issue is that these small communities simply do not have the money to build and run water treatment systems.

Many environmental groups such as Community Water Center and Clean Water Action are backing SB 623 in hopes it bill will bring relief to these communities, where residents feel their calls for help have long been ignored.

The water in Alpaugh is contaminated by arsenic, and Meraz refuses to drink or cook with the water, resulting in her having to pay a large amount of money on bottled water, while still paying a monthly water bill. The passage of SB 623 would solve this problem not only for Alpaugh but also for over 300 other California communities who also struggle with lack of safe, clean, and affordable drinking water. SB 623 establishes a Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund, which would make short- and long-term drinking water solutions available to low-income Californians who lack safe and affordable drinking water. Further, SB 623 would assist with operations and maintenance costs for low-income communities that can’t afford treatment for their drinking water.","October 01, 2017","['Hanford', 'Sacramento', 'Merced', 'Watsonville', 'Arvin', 'Alpaugh', 'Bakersfield']","['Sacramento', 'Merced', 'Kern']",San Joaquin Valley Op-Eds in Support of SB 623 - Community Water Center,https://www.communitywatercenter.org/op_ed_sb_623

They expressed that federal funding needs to be made available for low-income communities which have never had centralized infrastructure to secure safe and affordable water, often through consolidations and interties.","October 07, 2016","['Fresno', 'Armona', 'Porterville', 'Sacramento', 'Merced', 'Watsonville', 'Seville', 'Arvin', 'Bakersfield']","['Sacramento', 'Merced', 'Fresno']",AGUA and CWC Host Federal EPA Officials - Community Water Center,https://www.communitywatercenter.org/epa_officials

"First, we propose incorporating a public goods charge or water fee designed to ensure affordable drinking water for low-income customers. The fund created could then be used to support rate subsidies to customers, or regional projects like consolidations that would lower the cost of water delivery for the long term. Second, we suggest water utilities consider policies that encourage water use efficiency and conservation when designing affordability programs. This could be done by waiving or applying discounts to the fixed portion of the water bill rather than the variable portion of the water bill that reflects customer usage. It could also be done by offering a percentage discount on the total water bill based on reducing average water use for a particular household size. Third, we encourage the State Water Board to consider conservation pricing policies that address water use equitably and fairly by adopting policies that promote conservation not just with domestic water users, but with industrial, commercial, and agricultural users as well. And fourth, we recommend creating a fund to support operations and maintenance costs where appropriate to ensure that water is safe and affordable, and to make conservation pricing an option in some disadvantaged (DACs) where it is not currently an option due to the unaffordability of installing meters. This fund could be derived from a fertilizer fee at the rate of state sales tax to address nitrate contamination. Another potential funding source would be fees or enforcement actions to require parties responsible for contamination to contribute an appropriate share of the cost of providing safe drinking water.","July 10, 2015","['Watsonville', 'Sacramento']",['Sacramento'],Toward Water Conservation and Water Affordability - Community Water Center,https://www.communitywatercenter.org/conservation_pricing

According to the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, 40 percent of the country’s coal ash ponds are located in the southeast and contain 118 billion gallons of toxic material. Most of these impoundments, like the one on the Dan River, are located near major waterways.","February 17, 2014\r\n· ', '\xa0 By: Sean Breslin Published on March 24, 2017 Read the original story HERE Nearly 300 water systems in California did not comply with safe drinking water standards, many","['Tulare', 'Fresno', 'Davis', 'Elk', 'Visalia', 'Salinas', 'Stockton', 'Sacramento', 'Watsonville', 'Armona', 'Jackson']","['Tulare', 'Sierra', 'Fresno', 'Lake', 'Sacramento', 'Nevada']",Water in America: Is It Safe to Drink? - Community Water Center,https://www.communitywatercenter.org/water_in_america_is_it_safe_to_drink

" KERN COUNTY, CA – Five Head Start Centers and four schools in the south Kern County communities of Arvin and Lamont are getting relief from arsenic contamination in public schools. Community Action Partnership of Kern (CAPK), the Arvin Union School District, and Community Water Center worked with local community group,Committee for A Better Arvin (CBA), and a broad set of funding and in-kind donation partners to deliver safe drinking water to local school sites by installing water filters at playground and classroom drinking fountains sites and kitchen cooking areas. This effort is seen as a pilot model for securing immediate access to safe drinking water while long-term solutions are being pursued.","November 07, 2013","['Laws', 'Lamont', 'Tulare', 'Armona', 'Ceres', 'Sacramento', 'Westport', 'Watsonville', 'Arvin', 'Bakersfield']","['Sacramento', 'Tulare', 'Kern']",Press Release: Schools with arsenic contamination soon to have safe drinking water - Community Water Center,https://www.communitywatercenter.org/press_release_schools_with_arsenic_contamination_soon_to_have_safe_drinking_water
